// lint-conventions.mjs — TASK-ENV-001: the umbrella convention linter (owner 2026-06-22, STRICT).
//
// PRINCIPLE: no convention is "binding" until a TOOL enforces it (else it's advisory and rots).
// This is the single gate that runs every registered convention check, aggregates the result, and
// exits with the total violation count — so a pre-commit hook / CI / run-phase-close can gate on it.
// New enforcers (TASK-SEC-002 mutation gate, TASK-DOC-004 doc↔source drift, #218 coverage cross-check)
// REGISTER here as they land — one place to see "are all conventions green?".
//
// Each check is a child script whose EXIT CODE = its violation count (0 = clean). Run from repo root.
//
// Flags:
//   --soft   always exit 0 (report-only) — for wiring into run-phase-close before the baseline hits 0.
//   --json   emit machine-readable JSON (for #218 coverage cross-check to consume).
