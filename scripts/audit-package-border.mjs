/**
 * audit-package-border.mjs — Hardened Border CI gate (#149), ENFORCING + fail-closed.
 *
 * Re-scans EVERY package under packages-galerina/ FROM SOURCE with the real scanner and enforces that
 * package's committed `.graph/boundary-policy.json` allowlist. This is the zero-trust gate: it does NOT
 * trust the committed `.graph/package-graph.json` (the artifact a drift-introducer controls) — it
 * RE-DERIVES the external import surface from source, then FAILS the build on:
 *   • an external import not in allowedExternal           (drift past the Hardened Border)
 *   • a missing boundary-policy.json under enforcement    (delete-to-launder defence — see reporter.js)
 *   • a malformed/non-array allowlist                     (unknown → deny, never allow-all)
 *
 * Anti-neuter: a `--self-test` proves the gate still FIRES (on an unlisted external AND a missing policy)
 * before the enforcing sweep — a border gate that has been silently defanged is itself a fail-open.
 *
 * Requires the scanner to be BUILT first (`tsc` on galerina-devtools-package-graph — it is pure TS with no
 * third-party deps, so the CI build is just tsc, no `npm install` of package deps). If the scanner dist is
 * absent the gate EXITS NON-ZERO rather than skipping (a gate that can't run must not pass).
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/audit-package-border.mjs --self-test   # prove the detector fires, then exit 0
 *   node scripts/audit-package-border.mjs               # self-test + enforcing sweep (CI)
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 clean · 1 boundary violation(s) found · 2 gate could not run / detector neutered.
 *
 * Residual (honestly scoped): orphan-file findings are advisory here (parity with the CLI --check, which
 * exits 1 only on boundary FAIL). #40 tracks scanner bare-subpath vs relative-form border identity.
