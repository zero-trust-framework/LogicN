# Galerina Package Collection

`packages-galerina/` is the home for active reusable Galerina packages in this beta
workspace. It is split from ordinary app/vendor packages.

Current beta rule:

```text
packages/       normal app/vendor package space
packages-galerina/    Galerina package collection and beta Galerina package experiments
```

The long-term direction is:

```text
my-galerina-app/
|-- package.json       normal app/runtime ecosystem dependencies
|-- package-galerina.json    Galerina package manifest
|-- galerina.lock.json       locked Galerina package graph
|-- packages/          normal vendor/app packages
|-- packages-galerina/       Galerina packages, optionally a nested Git repository
|-- boot.fungi
`-- main.fungi
```

`packages-galerina/` may later become its own Git repository or submodule. If a
`.git` directory is added, it must be intentional and documented.

## Production Boundary

Production app installs should only fetch Galerina packages required by the selected
runtime profile. Development-only packages, staging packages, diagnostics,
generators and experimental packages should require an explicit development or
staging profile.

## V1 Surface Freeze

The active v1 surface is intentionally narrow:

```text
core language syntax
core type system
explicit Result / Option error and missing-value handling
memory-safety model
CPU target
WASM target
core reports, config, security, runtime, compiler and CLI tooling
core network I/O policy and report contracts
```

Everything beyond CPU and WASM target support is post-v1 unless it is required
to specify the core type system. Domain packages and regulated/safety-heavy
packages should stay outside the active workspace until the parser, memory
model and v1 examples are stable.

## Naming

Package names follow the family-prefix rule documented in
`../docs/PACKAGE_NAMING.md`.

Use:

```text
galerina-[family]-[purpose]
```

Development-only packages should use `galerina-devtools-*` or `galerina-tools-*` so they are
not mistaken for production runtime dependencies.

- `galerina-cpu-kernels/` - optimized CPU kernel contracts.
- `galerina-framework-app-kernel/` - optional secure application kernel.
- `galerina-framework-api-server/` - built-in HTTP API transport package.
- `galerina-framework-example-app/` - minimal example/template app package.
- `galerina-devtools-project-graph/` - development-only project graph tooling.
- `galerina-tools-benchmark/` - benchmark and diagnostic tooling.

Archived package planning lives outside this active workspace:

```text
C:\laragon\www\Galerina_Archive\packages-galerina\galerina-finance-core
C:\laragon\www\Galerina_Archive\packages-galerina\galerina-electrical-core
C:\laragon\www\Galerina_Archive\packages-galerina\galerina-ot-core
```

Enterprise-only packages live outside this active package collection:

```text
../packages-galerina-enterprise/
```

The compliance package family has been moved there and must not be treated as
part of the active v1 build graph unless explicitly unlocked.
