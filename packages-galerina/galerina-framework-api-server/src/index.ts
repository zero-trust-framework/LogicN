/**
 * Galerina HTTP / HTTPS API-server adapter.
 *
 * A DELIBERATELY THIN node:http / node:https transport in front of the App Kernel.
 * Its only job is to turn a raw request into a normalised `GalerinaKernelRequest`,
 * hand it to `kernel.handle()`, and write the kernel's typed response back onto
 * the socket. It is NOT a place for policy, middleware, auth, or routing — all
 * of that lives in the kernel's fixed, non-bypassable pipeline and MUST NOT be
 * pre-empted, re-ordered, or skipped here.
 *
 * There are two ADDITIVE exceptions — neither pre-empts, re-orders, or relaxes the
 * kernel's gate ordering; both are evaluated by the kernel, not the transport:
 *   1. A hard cap on how many body bytes the adapter will buffer before it even
 *      calls the kernel (DoS guard). The kernel ALSO enforces its own per-route,
 *      posture-aware body-size policy; this cap never removes or relaxes it. When
 *      the cap trips we respond 413 and destroy the socket WITHOUT buffering more.
 *   2. An OPTIONAL channel/identity verdict (TLSTP S1 cert-gate) fed to the kernel.
 *      The kernel folds it FAIL-CLOSED in its auth step as an authentication factor:
 *      only +1/ALLOW (e.g. a fully-validated, pinned, fresh-revocation client cert)
 *      authenticates the channel; 0/−1 deny. A verified channel authenticates in
 *      lieu of a bearer token (mutual-TLS semantics); it does not relax any other
 *      gate. There are two ways to supply it, in precedence order:
 *        a. an explicit `resolveChannelVerdict` hook (advanced / custom transports);
 *        b. the built-in `tls` mode — pass key/cert (+ optional `ca`, `pinnedDigests`,
 *           `checkRevocation`, …) and the adapter stands up an HTTPS server, reads the
 *           peer cert via `getPeerCertificate(true)`, maps the Node TLS library's
 *           outcomes into a `CertGateInput`, calls the shipped `certGate`, and sets
 *           `channelVerdict = decision.verdict`.
 *      Both are unset by default → no channel verdict is supplied → the adapter behaves
 *      exactly as before, leaving admission entirely to the kernel's own auth gate. A
 *      throwing resolver / unreadable cert factor DENIES (fail-closed).
 *
 * Binding posture: all crypto / TLS / X.509 path-building / signature math stays in
 * the Node TLS library (Binary / digital). This adapter performs NONE of it — it only
 * reads the library's already-decided outcomes and folds K3 trits via `certGate`.
