/**
 * bitnet-cpu-bridge.ts — the first real `implements InferenceBridge`
 *
 * Governed CPU ternary bridge for Microsoft BitNet (MIT). Wraps the native
 * ggml-bitnet kernels when the compiled addon is present; otherwise falls back to
 * the byte-faithful TPLSimulator from @galerina/tower-citizen.
 *
 * Upholds the three Citizen One Bridge Standards:
 *   1. Determinism Hook — every native result is cross-checked against the
 *      simulator reference; a mismatch is a CRITICAL failure (assertDeterminism).
 *   2. Governance Signal — canCommit() runs the GovernanceEnforcer before any
 *      native execution; a denied transition blocks the kernel.
 *   3. Zero-Copy Memory — accepts Int32Array (a WASM-memory view) directly; the
 *      native addon reads the same buffer (no serialisation in the hot path).
