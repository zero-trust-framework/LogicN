/**
 * bitnet-gpu-bridge.ts — governed GPU ternary bridge (detection + CUDA seam)
 *
 * Detects an NVIDIA GPU (real, via nvidia-smi) and reports it. The actual CUDA
 * BitNet kernel (C:\wwwprojects\BitNet\gpu\) is a documented seam — until it is
 * compiled into the native addon, this bridge runs the simulator reference and
 * reports executedNatively=false with the detected GPU recorded, so callers know
 * the hardware exists but the kernel is pending.
 *
 * Same three Bridge Standards as the CPU bridge: determinism cross-check,
 * governance signal, zero-copy buffers.
