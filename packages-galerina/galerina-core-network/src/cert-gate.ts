/**
 * cert-gate.ts — TLSTP S1: the K3 cert/channel-validation governance gate.
 *
 * A PURE governance pass. It takes the *outputs* of crypto/TLS validation (already
 * performed by a TLS/PKI library) as four sub-verdicts, folds them with the shipped
 * Kleene-K3 reduce (`allOf` = `vAnd`-reduce = numeric `min` over the trit), and
 * collapses to a single fail-closed `BoundaryDecision` via `decideAtBoundary`.
 *
 * It performs **no** ASN.1 parsing, path-building, signature math, or OCSP/CRL
 * parsing itself — that is the TLS library's job. This module only folds trits.
 *
 * Headline property (the reason S1 exists): a revocation-UNKNOWN sub-verdict (`0`)
 * collapses the whole channel to DENY. That closes the soft-fail hole the public
 * web tolerates (responder-down ⇒ allow). Unknown→DENY is forced by the algebra
 * (`vAnd(0, +1) = 0`; `+1` is the conjunctive identity and contributes nothing
 * toward overriding a `0`), NOT by a configurable flag.
 *
 * Fail-closed seam: in `toSubVerdicts`, the default for every missing / errored /
 * un-provable factor is `0` (INDETERMINATE), never `+1`. Mapping a timed-out or
 * errored factor to ALLOW is exactly the web's soft-fail mistake — it is encoded
 * once here and tested for each of the four factors.
 *
 * Binding posture: crypto / KDF / cipher / signature / key bytes stay Binary
 * (digital). Any photonic / analog signal is a degrade-only extra `vAnd` operand
 * (`withSideSignal`): by No-Coercion (`min(t*, r) ≤ t*`) it can only LOWER the
 * verdict, never lift a `0 → +1`, so it may contribute without ever becoming a key.
 *
