/**
 * admission-feedback.ts — the telemetry → K3 admission feedback loop (the closed
 * runtime self-throttle). TritMesh R&D 2026-06-23 net-new mechanic #1.
 *
 * Both halves of this loop already shipped independently: blind observability
 * (galerina-observability — health/readiness + error-rate metrics) and the
 * degrade-only side-signal operand (cert-gate.ts `withSideSignal`). What was
 * missing is the wire BETWEEN them: mapping a LIVE telemetry/health reading into a
 * degrade-only `Verdict` and folding it into the admission/cert verdict, so a node
 * under attack auto-throttles ALLOW → INDETERMINATE without a human in the loop.
 *
 * The single safety property, inherited verbatim from the K3 algebra (NOT re-proved
 * here): the telemetry operand is **degrade-only**. It is at most `+1` (ALLOW = the
 * conjunctive identity, "contribute nothing"), so folding it via `vAnd` (= numeric
 * `min`, No-Coercion `min(t*, r) ≤ t*`) can only LOWER an admission verdict, never
 * lift it. A noisy, spoofed, or adversary-influenced telemetry signal can throttle a
 * channel toward DENY but can NEVER manufacture an ALLOW. It is never a key/KDF/
 * cipher byte — crypto stays Binary; this is a governance side-signal only.
 *
 * Two fail-closed seams, deliberately distinct:
 *  1. An EMPTY reading (`{}` — no telemetry to report) yields `+1` (a no-op). Adding
 *     this operand to a gate that has no telemetry wired must NOT brick every
 *     channel; the loop only degrades on POSITIVE evidence of anomaly.
 *  2. A SUPPLIED-but-unreadable reading (health = an unknown string; an anomaly
 *     score that is NaN / out of [0,1]) degrades to `0` — telemetry that is present
 *     but garbage is treated as anomalous, never as healthy.
