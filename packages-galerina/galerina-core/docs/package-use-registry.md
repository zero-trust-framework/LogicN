# Galerina Package Use Registry

This document describes the proposed **Package Use Registry** model for **Galerina /
Galerina**.

Galerina is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and
accelerator-aware programming language concept.

The Package Use Registry gives Galerina one controlled place to approve, configure
and secure third-party packages before they are used by application code.

Status: Draft. This syntax is not parsed or enforced by the v0.1 prototype yet.

The Package Use Registry is backed by the governed Package Resolver. The
registry describes approved package use; the resolver finds, verifies, loads and
links approved packages/modules before execution. The resolver is not an
autoloader and must not silently load files because source references them.

For external package sources, the Certified Package Registry sits before the
Package Resolver. It publishes package evidence such as publisher, signature,
approved version, capabilities, effects, risk rating, security review status and
certification level. The Package Use Registry still controls whether a project
uses that package, and the resolver still verifies and links it.

---

## Summary

Galerina should distinguish between:

```text
import = import a local Galerina file or module
use    = use an approved package, standard library module or third-party dependency
```

This keeps the language clear.

```Galerina
import "./types.fungi"
import "./routes.fungi"

use GraphQL
use std.json
use std.http
```

Recommended rule:

```text
Import local files.
Use approved packages.
Register packages in boot.fungi.
Use packages explicitly in source files.
```

---

## Core Principle

```text
boot.fungi owns package approval.
source files use approved packages.
import remains for local Galerina files.
the compiler owns dependency checking and reporting.
```

This keeps developer code readable while still giving Galerina strong security and
memory control.

Resolver rule:

```text
Imports are not trust.
Packages must be resolved, verified and governed before use.
```

## Galerina Workspace Packages

The workspace contains first-party Galerina packages that should be referenced by
package name and updated in their owning docs:

```text
galerina-core              = language syntax, compiler contracts and core safety rules
galerina-core-compiler          = compiler pipeline contracts
galerina-core-runtime           = checked and compiled Galerina execution contracts
galerina-core-security          = reusable security primitives and security report contracts
galerina-core-config            = project config and environment mode contracts
galerina-core-reports           = shared report schemas, processing reports and writer contracts
galerina-core-logic             = Tri, Galerina, Decision, RiskLevel and Omni logic
galerina-core-vector            = vector, matrix, tensor, lanes, dimensions and numeric operations
galerina-core-compute           = compute planning, capabilities, budgets and target selection
galerina-ai                = generic AI inference contracts and safety policy
galerina-ai-lowbit         = low-bit and ternary AI inference contracts
galerina-ai-agent             = supervised AI agent, tool permission and task group contracts
galerina-ai-neural            = neural model, layer, inference and training contracts
galerina-ai-neuromorphic      = spike, event-signal and spiking model contracts
galerina-core-photonic     = wavelength, phase, amplitude and optical signal concepts
galerina-target-cpu        = CPU target capability and fallback planning
galerina-cpu-kernels       = optimized CPU kernel contracts
galerina-target-native     = future native executable target planning and artifact metadata
galerina-target-wasm       = WebAssembly target planning and output contracts
galerina-target-gpu        = GPU target planning and output contracts
galerina-target-ai-accelerator = NPU, TPU, AI-chip and passive backend profile planning
galerina-target-photonic   = photonic backend and optical I/O target planning
galerina-framework-app-kernel        = secure application/API runtime boundary
galerina-framework-api-server        = built-in HTTP transport package
galerina-core-cli               = developer command-line tooling
galerina-core-tasks             = safe project automation
galerina-tools-benchmark         = benchmark diagnostics and privacy-safe reports
galerina-devtools-project-graph     = project knowledge graph and AI assistant map contracts
```

`galerina-core` owns the package registry syntax and compiler/report contract.
Package-specific semantics belong in the owning package.

---

## Why This Matters

Third-party packages can affect:

```text
security
memory usage
startup time
runtime performance
deployment size
AI understanding
supply-chain risk
licence compliance
build repeatability
```

A central package registry helps Galerina avoid uncontrolled dependency use.

The registry question is not only:

```text
Can this dependency be downloaded?
```

It is also:

```text
Should this dependency be allowed authority in this runtime context?
```

Installed does not mean trusted. Certified does not mean unrestricted.

---

## import vs use

| Keyword | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `import` | Import local Galerina source files/modules | `import "./types.fungi"` |
| `use` | Use approved packages or standard library modules | `use GraphQL` |
| `use std.*` | Use Galerina standard library modules | `use std.json` |

---

## Example File Structure

```text
my-galerina-app/
|-- boot.fungi
`-- src/
    |-- main.fungi
    |-- types.fungi
    `-- routes/
        `-- graphql.fungi
```

---

## Example boot.fungi

```Galerina
project "GraphQLDemo"

entry "./src/main.fungi"

imports {
  import "./src/types.fungi"
  import "./src/routes/graphql.fungi"
}

packages {
  use GraphQL from "./vendor/graphql" {
    version "1.4.2"

    permissions {
      network "deny"
      file_read "deny"
      file_write "deny"
      environment "deny"
      native_bindings "deny"
      unsafe "deny"
    }

    security {
      lock_hash "sha256:..."
      audit_required true
      aLOw_transitive_permissions false
    }

    loading {
      mode "lazy"
      share_instance true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Example Source File

```Galerina
import "../types.fungi"

use GraphQL
use std.json

/// @purpose Handles a GraphQL request using an approved package.
/// @input Request
/// @output Result<Response, ApiError>
/// @effects [network.inbound]
secure flow handleGraphQL(req: Request) -> Result<Response, ApiError>
effects [network.inbound] {
  let query: GraphQL.Query = GraphQL.parse(req.body)

  let result = GraphQL.execute(query)

  return JsonResponse(result)
}
```

The source file uses:

```Galerina
import "../types.fungi"
```

for local files.

It uses:

```Galerina
use GraphQL
```

for an approved package.

---

## Package Approval Rule

```text
A source file may only use external packages that are registered in boot.fungi.
```

Valid:

```Galerina
use GraphQL
```

if `GraphQL` is registered in:

```Galerina
packages {
  use GraphQL from "./vendor/graphql" {
    ...
  }
}
```

Invalid:

```Galerina
use RandomUnknownPackage
```

Expected compiler error:

```text
Use error:
RandomUnknownPackage is not registered in boot.fungi.

Original source:
  src/routes/example.fungi:1:1

Suggestion:
  Add the package to the packages registry in boot.fungi with version, permissions and loading rules.
```

---

## Parser and Checker Support

The compiler should parse package approval and file-level usage separately.

Parser support:

```text
parse boot.fungi packages blocks
parse package aliases and source locations
parse version declarations
parse permissions blocks
parse security blocks
parse lock_hash values
parse loading modes
parse source-file use statements
```

Checker support:

```text
reject unregistered package use
warn for registered packages that are never used
reject permissions broader than project policy
reject missing lock_hash in strict/release builds
reject native bindings unless explicitly trusted and audited
emit package use report entries
emit security report entries
```

This keeps parser behaviour, package approval checks and package reporting in one auditable model.

---

## Explicit File-Level Use

Galerina should avoid magic global package access.

Bad model:

```text
Package is registered in boot.fungi.
Package is automatically available in every source file.
```

Better model:

```text
Package is registered in boot.fungi.
Each file uses the package explicitly.
```

Reason:

```text
developers can see dependencies
AI can understand file-level usage
compiler can track package effects
security reports can show usage
memory reports can show loading behaviour
unused packages can be detected
```

Recommended model:

```text
registered globally = approved for use
used explicitly = required by this file
```

---

## Standard Library Use

Galerina standard library modules should also use `use`.

```Galerina
use std.json
use std.http
use std.crypto
use std.env
```

This makes standard library usage clear and consistent.

---

## Local File Imports

Local Galerina files should use `import`.

```Galerina
import "./types.fungi"
import "./services/order-service.fungi"
import "./routes/orders.fungi"
```

`import` should not be used for third-party packages.

---

## Package Version

Every third-party package should declare a version.

```Galerina
packages {
  use GraphQL from "./vendor/graphql" {
    version "1.4.2"
  }
}
```

This supports:

```text
repeatable builds
dependency audits
security checks
AI guide summaries
build manifests
```

---

## Package Lock Hash

A package may declare a lock hash.

```Galerina
security {
  lock_hash "sha256:..."
}
```

This helps detect supply-chain changes.

If the package content does not match the lock hash, Galerina should fail or warn
depending on project policy.

---

## Package Permissions

Packages should declare the permissions they are aLOwed to use.

```Galerina
permissions {
  network "deny"
  file_read "deny"
  file_write "deny"
  environment "deny"
  native_bindings "deny"
  unsafe "deny"
}
```

A GraphQL parser should not normally need:

```text
network access
file writes
environment access
native bindings
unsafe code
```

If a package requests risky permissions, Galerina should report it.

Permission error example:

```text
Package security warning:
GraphQL requested environment access, but boot.fungi denies it.

Declared:
  boot.fungi:18:7

Suggestion:
  Keep environment access denied unless this package genuinely requires it.
```

---

## Memory Management

Packages should have loading rules.

```Galerina
loading {
  mode "lazy"
  share_instance true
}
```

Meaning:

```text
load package only when first used
reuse one shared package instance
avoid duplicate package memory
track package memory use
```

---

## Loading Modes

Recommended loading modes:

```text
lazy
eager
compile
external
```

### lazy

Load when first used. Good for most packages.

```Galerina
loading {
  mode "lazy"
}
```

### eager

Load at startup. Good for core packages needed immediately.

```Galerina
loading {
  mode "eager"
}
```

### compile

Compile/link into the build if supported. Good for production builds where
dependency contents are known.

```Galerina
loading {
  mode "compile"
}
```

### external

Use an external runtime package. Useful where the package is provided by the
environment.

```Galerina
loading {
  mode "external"
}
```

---

## Shared Instance

For memory management, Galerina should avoid loading the same package multiple times.

```Galerina
loading {
  share_instance true
}
```

Meaning:

```text
one approved package instance
many source files can use it
no duplicate runtime package copies
```

---

## Package Use Report

Galerina should generate package reports.

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "name": "./vendor/graphql",
      "alias": "GraphQL",
      "version": "1.4.2",
      "loading": "lazy",
      "sharedInstance": true,
      "permissions": {
        "network": "deny",
        "fileRead": "deny",
        "fileWrite": "deny",
        "environment": "deny",
        "nativeBindings": "deny",
        "unsafe": "deny"
      },
      "usedBy": [
        "src/routes/graphql.fungi"
      ],
      "status": "approved"
    }
  ]
}
```

This should feed into:

```text
app.security-report.json
app.ai-guide.md
app.map-manifest.json
app.build-manifest.json
```

---

## Security Report Integration

The security report should include:

```text
registered packages
versions
permissions
native binding use
unsafe use
environment access
file access
network access
lock hash status
transitive permission status
```

Example:

```json
{
  "packageSecurity": {
    "status": "ok",
    "packages": [
      {
        "alias": "GraphQL",
        "version": "1.4.2",
        "lockHashValid": true,
        "unsafe": "deny",
        "nativeBindings": "deny",
        "environment": "deny"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

---

## AI Guide Integration

The AI guide should explain package use.

```markdown
## Packages

### GraphQL

Source package:
`thirdparty/graphql`

Version:
`1.4.2`

Loading:
lazy, shared instance

Permissions:
- network: denied
- file read: denied
- file write: denied
- environment: denied
- native bindings: denied
- unsafe: denied

Used by:
- `src/routes/graphql.fungi`
```

This helps AI assistants understand dependencies without scanning the whole
project.

---

## Build Manifest Integration

The build manifest should include package versions and hashes.

```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "alias": "GraphQL",
      "package": "./vendor/graphql",
      "version": "1.4.2",
      "hash": "sha256:..."
    }
  ]
}
```

This helps repeatable builds and deployment verification.

---

## Map Manifest Integration

The map manifest should connect packages to source usage.

```json
{
  "packageUsage": [
    {
      "alias": "GraphQL",
      "registered": "boot.fungi:12",
      "usedBy": [
        "src/routes/graphql.fungi:1"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Diagnostics

If a package is registered but never used, Galerina should warn.

```text
Package warning:
GraphQL is registered in boot.fungi but never used.

Declared:
  boot.fungi:12:3

Suggestion:
  Remove the package registration or use it explicitly with `use GraphQL`.
```

If a source file uses a package that is not registered:

```Galerina
use Payments
```

Galerina should report:

```text
Use error:
Payments is not registered in boot.fungi.

Original source:
  src/payments/payment-service.fungi:1:1

Suggestion:
  Register Payments in boot.fungi under packages.
```

---

## Dependency Rule

```text
Galerina packages must be declared before they are used.
```

This makes dependency behaviour:

```text
auditable
repeatable
AI-readable
secure by default
```

---

## Recommended Syntax Summary

Local files:

```Galerina
import "./types.fungi"
import "./routes/orders.fungi"
```

Standard library:

```Galerina
use std.json
use std.http
use std.crypto
```

Third-party package registration:

```Galerina
packages {
  use GraphQL from "./vendor/graphql" {
    version "1.4.2"

    permissions {
      network "deny"
      file_read "deny"
      file_write "deny"
      environment "deny"
      native_bindings "deny"
      unsafe "deny"
    }

    loading {
      mode "lazy"
      share_instance true
    }
  }
}
```

Third-party package usage:

```Galerina
use GraphQL
```

---

## Non-Goals

The Package Use Registry should not:

```text
make every package globally available automatically
allow unregistered third-party packages
hide package permissions
hide package memory use
allow unsafe native bindings silently
allow packages to read secrets by default
make local file imports and package usage ambiguous
```

---

## Open Questions

```text
Should standard library modules need registration in boot.fungi?
Should third-party packages require lock_hash in production?
Should packages be aLOwed to request permissions themselves?
Should transitive dependencies be listed in the report?
Should package loading be lazy by default?
Should package memory use be reported at runtime?
Should unused package registrations fail production builds?
```

---

## Recommended Early Version

Version 0.1:

```text
define import for local files
define use for packages
define packages registry in boot.fungi
require source files to use registered packages explicitly
```

Version 0.2:

```text
add package permissions
add unused package warnings
add unregistered use errors
add package security report
```

Version 0.3:

```text
add lock hashes
add loading modes
add shared instance reporting
add AI guide package summary
```

---

## Final Principle

Galerina should make dependencies clear, safe and memory-aware.

Final rule:

```text
Import files.
Use packages.
Register packages once.
Use them explicitly where needed.
Load lazily and share safely.
Report permissions and memory behaviour.
```
