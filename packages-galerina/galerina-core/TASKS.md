# Galerina Tasks

This document tracks practical tasks for **Galerina / Galerina**.

Galerina is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and accelerator-aware programming language concept.

The goal of this file is to break the project into clear work areas that can be completed step by step.

---

## Task Status Key

Use the following status labels:

```text
[ ] Not started
[/] In progress
[x] Complete
[!] Blocked
[?] Needs decision
```

Example:

```text
[ ] Write grammar draft
[/] Draft README
[x] Choose .fungi extension
[?] Decide boot.fungi vs main.fungi
[!] Real photonic backend blocked by hardware access
```

---

## Current Project Stage

Current stage:

```text
Concept, documentation, package-boundary and v0.1 prototype planning
```

The project has an early Node.js-hosted checked interpreter/prototype. The
current task list should distinguish core language/compiler contracts from
package-owned implementation details.

The current priority is to define:

```text
language purpose
project structure
syntax direction
safety rules
JSON/API model
compiler architecture
build outputs
AI-friendly reports
security model
licence model
Git workflow
package boundaries
```

---

## Completed Decisions

```text
[x] Project name: Galerina / Galerina
[x] Source file extension: .fungi
[x] Language should be strict typed
[x] Language should be memory safe
[x] Language should be security-first
[x] Language should be JSON-native
[x] Language should be API-native
[x] Language should support webhooks
[x] Language should include GPU as a first-class target concept
[x] Language should include photonic target planning
[x] Language should include ternary / 3-way simulation
[x] Runtime .env should stay outside compiled output
[x] Compiler should generate source maps
[x] Compiler should generate AI-readable reports
[x] Licence direction: Apache License 2.0
[x] Build output should include target/security/failure/source-map reports
[x] Documentation bundle should include Git docs
[x] Tri uses Positive/Neutral/Negative for value-level ternary state
[x] First practical implementation target: Node.js-hosted checked interpreter/prototype
[x] Separate Galerina core language concerns from the optional Secure App Kernel layer
[x] Support simple `console.log("...")` output in checked Run Mode
[x] Document package boundaries from `galerina-core` to `galerina-core-logic`, `galerina-core-vector`,
    `galerina-core-compute`, `galerina-core-photonic`, target packages, CLI and task packages
[x] Split compiler, runtime, security, config, reports, WASM target and GPU
    target responsibilities into dedicated package TODOs
[x] Split AI inference, low-bit AI backend, CPU target and CPU kernel
    responsibilities into dedicated package TODOs
```

---

## Open Decisions

```text
[?] Should the main entry file be boot.fungi or main.fungi?
[?] Should boot.fungi contain both project config and executable logic?
[?] Should Galerina.config be required or optional?
[?] Should Galerina use braces only, indentation only, or braces with optional formatting?
[?] Should functions be called flow, fn, function, or task?
[?] Should secure flow be a keyword or an annotation?
[?] Should Result and Option be built into the language or standard library?
[?] Should Decision be built in or standard library?
[?] Should rollback be available everywhere or only in secure flows?
[?] Should compute blocks be required for accelerator targeting?
[?] Decide the compiler implementation language after the runtime-first slice is clear.
[?] Should package management be built early or deferred?
[?] What syntax should Galerina use for explicit generic constraints or protocols?
[?] What shape-type syntax should vectors, matrices and tensors use?
```

---

## Backend Language Suggestion Tasks

```text
[ ] Define language edition metadata and compatibility diagnostics
[ ] Define compiler-facing Bool, Tri, Decision and Galerina syntax/report contracts
[ ] Specify algebraic variants, sealed state and exhaustive map requirements
[ ] Specify explicit generic constraints, traits or protocols
[ ] Specify structured concurrency, cancellation and typed streams
[ ] Specify deterministic cleanup for files, sockets, locks and FFI handles
[ ] Specify `let`, explicit `mut`, `readonly`, vault state, `secure` access and
    `Secret<T>` diagnostics; keep `const` deferred for v0.1; diagnose
    increment/decrement and assignment mutation without `mut`
[ ] Specify secure-by-default syntax diagnostics for deny-by-default
    permissions, explicit risky-action authority, request contracts, output
    targets, ownership checks, `view` exposure, secret-safe sinks, resource
    budgets, audit declarations, field-read rules and gated raw SQL
[ ] Specify security-invariant and policy-proof diagnostics for
    security-aware IR, mandatory classification, immutable execution plans, no
    ambient authority, hardened mode and proof/report output
[ ] Specify context-tagged verified execution cache diagnostics for verified
    plan reuse, cache tags, expiry, invalidation, specialist runtime caches and
    authority-neutral cache behaviour
[ ] Specify Package Resolver diagnostics for package/module identity,
    version/lockfile, hash/signature, registry, capabilities, effects,
    dependency conflicts, Governed IR linking and provenance reports
[ ] Specify Certified Package Registry diagnostics for publisher, signature,
    certification level, risk rating, security review status, capabilities,
    effects and lockfile evidence
[ ] Specify trust-conversion diagnostics for `safe`/`unsafe`, inert unsafe
    values, `validate`/`guard`/`sanitize`, safe-only `encode.*` and query
    interpolation denial
[ ] Specify built-in `Runtime.View` levels for public, internal, private,
    confidential, secret, restricted and regulated field exposure metadata
[ ] Specify standard view behaviour inheritance so permissions can reference
    built-in view rules, narrow them safely and report any explicit widening
[ ] Specify audit actor attribution rules so runtime context owns primary actor,
    request, route, flow, permission, capabilities, execution ID and result
    fields in audit events
[ ] Specify multi-actor audit metadata roles for affected, delegated, source,
    system and AI actors without allowing source code to override primary actor
    attribution
[/] Specify safe compile-time metadata and attributes, including a denial of
    runtime object inspection and behaviour mutation in normal Galerina code
[ ] Specify native ABI and foreign-call boundaries
[ ] Specify compiler-facing matrix/vector shape syntax and diagnostics
[ ] Specify AI-understandable architecture indexes for concepts, definitions,
    permissions, effects, contexts, package ownership and component metadata
[ ] Standardise diagnostics and AI report schemas
```

Package-boundary note:

```text
Tri / Galerina / Omni work should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-logic first.
Vector work should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-vector first.
Compute planning work should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-compute first.
AI inference work should update packages-galerina/galerina-ai first.
Low-bit AI backend work should update packages-galerina/galerina-ai-lowbit first.
Photonic vocabulary should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-photonic first.
Target backend work should update packages-galerina/galerina-target-native or
packages-galerina/galerina-target-cpu, packages-galerina/galerina-target-wasm, packages-galerina/galerina-target-gpu or
packages-galerina/galerina-target-photonic first.
CPU kernel work should update packages-galerina/galerina-cpu-kernels first.
Compiler pipeline work should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-compiler first.
Runtime execution work should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-runtime first.
Security primitive work should update packages-galerina/galerina-core-security first.

packages-galerina/galerina-core-reports first.
galerina-core should be updated when syntax, compiler validation or report contracts
change.
```

make Galerina safer
make Galerina clearer
make Galerina easier to debug
make Galerina better for JSON/API systems
make Galerina easier for AI tools to understand
make Galerina ready for multi-target compilation
make Galerina useful before future hardware arrives
```
