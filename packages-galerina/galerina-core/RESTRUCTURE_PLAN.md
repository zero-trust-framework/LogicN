# Galerina Repository Restructure Plan

This document describes the intended repository layout for Galerina and the documentation work needed to keep the language design coherent as it grows.

## Main Rule

The repository root should describe the project, its governance, legal status, contribution model, and high-level design.

Detailed language rules, runtime behaviour, compiler internals, target support, diagnostics, examples, and technical specifications should live in focused directories and documents.

Galerina may begin with ternary logic, but it should be designed as Omni-logic compatible from the start.

---

## Omni-Logic Compatibility Rule

Galerina must not be hard-coded as only a 3-way logic language.

The original Galerina concept focuses on 3-way / ternary logic because of the relationship with photonic and non-binary computing models.

However, the language should be designed as **Omni-logic compatible**, meaning future logic widths such as 4-way, 5-way or other multi-state systems can be supported without breaking the language design.

The language should support:

```text
binary logic      = 2-state logic
ternary logic     = 3-state logic
quaternary logic  = 4-state logic
n-state logic     = future configurable logic width
omni logic        = abstraction over multiple logic widths
```

The language should avoid naming internal systems in a way that prevents future expansion.

Prefer:

```text
logic-state
logic-width
logic-mode
logic-target
omni-logic
multi-state
```

Avoid hard-coding everything as:

```text
ternary-only
three-way-only
photonic-only
```

Galerina can still have ternary support as a first-class feature, but the compiler, runtime, schemas and documentation should be prepared for wider logic systems.

---

## Omni-Logic Design Requirement

Galerina should be designed around a logic abstraction layer.

The language may start with:

```text
binary
ternary
```

But the compiler should later aLOw:

```text
logic width 2
logic width 3
logic width 4
logic width 5
logic width n
```

Example conceptual syntax:

```Galerina
logic mode ternary

state false
state unknown
state true
```

Future-compatible conceptual syntax:

```Galerina
logic width 5

state false
state low
state unknown
state high
state true
```

The compiler should treat logic modes as target capabilities.

Example:

```text
target cpu {
  logic_width: 2
}

target ternary-sim {
  logic_width: 3
}

target omni-sim {
  logic_width: dynamic
}
```

This prevents Galerina from being trapped as a ternary-only language.

### Required Compiler Behaviour

The compiler should report when a selected target does not support the requested logic width.

Example warning:

```text
galerina-WARN-LOGIC-001: Target "cpu" does not natively support logic width 3. Falling back to binary simulation.
```

Example error:

```text
galerina-ERR-LOGIC-001: Target "ternary-sim" supports logic width 3, but this program requested logic width 5.
```

---

## Memory Error Correction

Galerina should include a documented model for memory error detection, correction and recovery.

This does not mean Galerina can magically fix faulty hardware. Instead, Galerina should standardise how the compiler and runtime detect, report and respond to memory-related problems.

Galerina should distinguish between:

```text
memory pressure       = memory is running low
memory limit reached  = aLOwed memory limit has been exceeded
memory corruption     = unexpected or invalid memory state detected
bad memory            = possible unreliable memory/hardware issue
cache overflow        = cache memory limit exceeded
disk spill            = memory data moved to disk
disk spill failure    = data could not be written to disk
rollback recovery     = previous safe state restored
```

### Expected Recovery Behaviour

Where possible, Galerina should attempt safe recovery in this order:

```text
1. warn
2. reduce cache use
3. move non-critical cache data to general memory
4. spill safe temporary data to disk
5. rollback to last safe checkpoint
6. fail safely with a structured error
```

### Memory Correction Features

Galerina should support or document:

```text
checkpointing
rollback
state verification
hash/checksum validation
safe retry
cache demotion
disk spill
structured memory reports
```

### Example Warning

```text
galerina-WARN-MEM-001: Cached memory limit reached. Cache entry moved to general memory.
```

### Example Error

```text
galerina-ERR-MEM-001: Memory integrity check failed. Runtime restored previous checkpoint.
```

### Example Fatal Error

```text
galerina-FATAL-MEM-001: Memory corruption detected and recovery failed. Execution stopped safely.
```

### Required Report Output

Memory reports should be written to a structured report format.

Example:

```json
{
  "code": "galerina-WARN-MEM-001",
  "level": "warning",
  "category": "memory",
  "message": "Cached memory limit reached. Cache entry moved to general memory.",
  "recoveryAction": "cache_demoted_to_general_memory",
  "source": {
    "file": "examples/cache-demo.fungi",
    "line": 42
  }
}
```

---

## Standardised Warnings and Diagnostics

Galerina should have standard warning, error and fatal diagnostic codes.

Diagnostics should use a predictable format:

```text
galerina-WARN-CATEGORY-NUMBER
galerina-ERR-CATEGORY-NUMBER
galerina-FATAL-CATEGORY-NUMBER
```

Examples:

```text
galerina-WARN-MEM-001
galerina-ERR-MEM-001
galerina-FATAL-MEM-001

galerina-WARN-DISK-001
galerina-ERR-DISK-001
galerina-FATAL-DISK-001

galerina-WARN-LOGIC-001
galerina-ERR-LOGIC-001

galerina-WARN-CACHE-001
galerina-ERR-CACHE-001

galerina-WARN-TARGET-001
galerina-ERR-TARGET-001
```

### Diagnostic Levels

```text
info     = useful information
warning  = problem detected, execution can continue
error    = operation failed, app may recover
fatal    = unsafe to continue
```

### Diagnostic Categories

```text
MEM       memory
DISK      disk and filesystem
CACHE     cache system
LOGIC     binary/ternary/omni logic
TARGET    compiler target support
TYPE      type system
NULL      null/undefined safety
SEC       security
ENV       environment variables
IO        input/output
NET       network
API       API calls
BUILD     build system
RUNTIME   runtime system
```

### Required Diagnostic Fields

All structured diagnostics should include:

```text
code
level
category
message
source file
source line
target
recovery action
timestamp
```

Example:

```json
{
  "code": "galerina-WARN-DISK-001",
  "level": "warning",
  "category": "disk",
  "message": "Available disk space is low.",
  "target": "cpu",
  "recoveryAction": "continue_with_warning",
  "source": {
    "file": "compiler/galerina.js",
    "line": 120
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-05-03T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Disk, Memory and Hardware Warnings

Galerina should standardise warnings for system health issues.

### Disk Warnings

galerina-WARN-DISK-001: Available disk space is low.
galerina-WARN-DISK-002: Disk write speed is below expected threshold.
galerina-WARN-DISK-003: Disk spill mode enabled due to memory pressure.

## README.md Fix

The README should become the project entry point, not the full specification.

It should include:

```text
project summary
core goals
quick start
repository structure
links to SPEC.md, DESIGN.md, ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/
current prototype status
contribution links
license links
```

Also add a short Omni-logic note:

```markdown
## Omni-Logic Direction

Galerina starts with strong support for binary and ternary logic, but the language should not be limited to only 3-way logic.

The long-term design goal is Omni-logic compatibility, aLOwing future logic widths such as 4-state, 5-state or configurable n-state systems where supported by the compiler, runtime or target backend.
```

---

3. Move detailed root-level technical files into docs/.
4. Add Omni-logic planning documents.
5. Add memory error correction planning documents.
6. Add warning and diagnostic code planning documents.
7. Update README.md links and short Omni-logic direction note.
8. Update TODO.md with missing documentation work.
9. Update CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased].
10. Run link checks and verify package scripts still work.
```

---

## Final Target

The repository should clearly show:

```text
root = Galerina package root
compiler/ = prototype compiler and CLI
examples/ = Galerina example source files
grammar/ = grammar and token definitions
schemas/ = generated report schemas
docs/ = detailed language design documents
tests/ = future tests
runtime/ = future runtime
tooling/ = future developer tooling
omni-logic = future-compatible logic-width abstraction
diagnostics = standard warnings, errors and fatal reports
```

Final rule:

```text
Galerina may begin with ternary logic, but it should be designed as Omni-logic compatible from the start.
```
