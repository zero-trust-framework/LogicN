/**
 * Governed component loader — fuses a built Galerina package's governed .wasm into
 * a host App Kernel (framework P1 slice 4 / Fuse B2, Net a).
 *
 * Fusion is the ONE-TIME, fail-closed admission of a separately-compiled package
 * at a declared seam. It is NOT a runtime middleware chain: the package is admitted
 * (hash + signature checked) and instantiated with a CLOSED, capability-bounded host
 * import object, then exposed as a {@link FusedComponent} the kernel calls directly.
 *
 * Three fail-closed gates, in order:
 *   1  .wasm sha256 MUST match the descriptor's wasmSha256 (else throw — tamper).
 *   2  the manifest signature MUST verify when a public key exists for its keyId
 *      (else throw). An unsigned / placeholder manifest is admitted ONLY when the
 *      caller passes `allowUnsigned: true`, and then only with a warning.
 *   3  the .wasm is instantiated with ONLY the host imports its DECLARED capabilities
 *      permit — deny-by-default. A capability the package did not declare gets NO
 *      host import (the import object simply has no entry for it).
 *
 * The AUTHORITATIVE fusion contract is the `fuse` block embedded inside the SIGNED
 * .lmanifest.json (Net a, Fuse B2 STEP A). The standalone <name>.fuse.json is a
 * convenience copy; when both exist the loader cross-checks them and treats the
 * signed manifest as the source of truth on any disagreement (fail-closed).
