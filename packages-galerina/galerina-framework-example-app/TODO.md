# Galerina Example App — status

Promoted from a doc-only scaffold to the **runnable golden template** (`galerina new app`).

```text
[x] App entry            src/App.fungi (composition-root flow main())
[x] App flow             src/flows/greeting.fungi (governed, contract{intent})
[x] Compute package      packages/greeting (pure flow -> signed, fusable .wasm)
[x] App descriptor       App.manifest (deny-by-default caps, deps[] hash+signer pin)
[x] Config               config/app.config.json + host/config.ts (typed, fail-closed)
[x] Route through kernel host/server.ts (fuse → createAppKernel → createApiServer)
[x] End-to-end test      tests/e2e.test.mjs (scaffold → fuse → kernel → serve)
[x] Build configuration  package.json + tsconfig.json
```

Next steps for a real app (not required for the template):

```text
[ ] Add more routes/flows and grant only the capabilities they need (effects {} + App.manifest)
[ ] Wire a revocation registry + central package registry into the fuse border
[ ] Commit contract-driven proofs (node ../../galerina.mjs generate tests src/App.fungi)
```
