// host/server.ts — the example app's host: it FUSES the governed greeting component,
// wires ONE route through the App Kernel's fixed pipeline, and serves it over HTTP.
// This is the only place the app's compiled .wasm meets the kernel.
//
// The pipeline of trust (scaffold -> fuse -> kernel -> serve):
//   1. `galerina build --package packages/greeting` produced a signed greeting.wasm +
//      greeting.lmanifest.json — deny-by-default, capabilities [].
//   2. fusePackage admits it FAIL-CLOSED: sha256 pin -> Ed25519 signature -> (optional)
//      revocation, then instantiates it with a CLOSED, capability-bounded import object.
//      A tampered, or unsigned-without-allowance, binary is refused — never run.
//   3. createAppKernel runs the fixed, non-bypassable gate pipeline. The /hello handler
//      is reached ONLY after the route, body-size, content-type, auth, decode,
//      idempotency and concurrency gates pass; it then invokes the fused component's
//      main() (the governed compute) for the HTTP status.
//   4. createApiServer is a thin transport that funnels every request through the
//      kernel — no policy, auth, or routing lives here.
