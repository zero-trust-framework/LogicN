/**
 * credential.ts — the required-auth POSTURE factor: "header presence is NOT
 * authentication."
 *
 * This encodes the tightened required-auth posture the App Kernel adopted (owner
 * decision 2026-06-23, see galerina-framework-app-kernel/src/kernel.ts auth step and
 * `AuthPolicy.allowHeaderPresenceFallback`). The kernel previously admitted a
 * `required`-auth route on mere Authorization-HEADER PRESENCE — which is not a real
 * verification of the token: any non-empty header passed. That is now fail-closed by
 * default; the weaker behaviour survives only as an explicit per-route opt-in.
 *
 * `headerPresenceVerdict` lifts that posture into a reusable FACTOR:
 *
 *   - DEFAULT (allowHeaderPresenceFallback !== true) — header presence is NOT
 *     authentication. The factor is ALWAYS `0` (INDETERMINATE): it carries no
 *     positive proof and can never authorize on its own. Folded into a composed
 *     auth verdict it pulls the result to non-ALLOW, and the kernel collapses that
 *     to deny (audited FUNGI-GOV-3VL-001). This factor exists to make the posture
 *     explicit and to refuse presence-as-proof structurally, not by a flag check.
 *
 *   - LEGACY OPT-IN (allowHeaderPresenceFallback === true) — mirrors the kernel's
 *     escape hatch: a non-empty Authorization header maps to `+1` (ALLOW); a missing
 *     or empty header maps to `0` (deny). Use ONLY for a deployment whose real token
 *     validation genuinely lives upstream.
 *
 * Hardening note: this factor treats a present-but-EMPTY header value as NOT present
 * (→ `0`), which is intentionally STRICTER than the kernel's legacy branch (which
 * checks key presence only and would admit an empty `Authorization:` under the
 * opt-in). A factor library must not reproduce that latent weakness.
 *
 * This module performs no token parsing, signature checks, or secret handling — it
 * is a posture factor over header SHAPE only. Real credential verification belongs
 * to the channel/identity factor (channel.ts) or an upstream verifier; its OUTPUT
 * can be composed in as another K3 verdict.
