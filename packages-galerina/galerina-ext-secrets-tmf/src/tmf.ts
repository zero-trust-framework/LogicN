// tmf.ts — single import seam onto the shipped @galerinaa/ext-tmf engine.
//
// The whole package is a THIN orchestration layer: it owns NO crypto and NO container
// bytes. Every byte primitive comes from @galerinaa/ext-tmf (writeTmf/readTmf, seal/open,
// buildContext, KEM_PROFILE 0x02, COMMIT_MODE.CTX). We re-export only what the
// orchestration needs so there is exactly ONE place that names the engine.
//
// Resolution: once this package is absorbed into packages-galerina/galerina-ext-secrets-tmf
// the workspace resolves "@galerinaa/ext-tmf" to its built dist. During in-staging build +
// test we resolve the same dist through a path alias (see tsconfig paths / the test
// loader shim). NO new crypto dependency is introduced here.
