/**
 * u64-arith.ts — strict-trapping UNSIGNED 64-bit integer arithmetic: the SINGLE source of truth for
 * Galerina's UInt64 overflow / underflow / divide-by-zero TRAP semantics. Sibling of i64-arith.ts.
 *
 * Owner decision (Fork A = TRAP) carried to unsigned 64-bit: arithmetic must NEVER silently wrap. Native
 * WebAssembly `i64.add/sub/mul` wrap mod 2^64 (a lying abstraction in a governed system), so Galerina
 * HARDENS that reference: every add/mul that exceeds 2^64-1, every subtraction that would go below 0
 * (unsigned underflow), and every divide/modulo by zero is a `LOAD → TRAP → ERASE` event, exactly as for
 * i64/i32. There is no silent 2^64-1 + 1 = 0 wraparound — that boundary TRAPS.
 *
 * Why a layer SEPARATE from i64-arith (the split FUNGI-NUMERIC-001 deliberately preserved): an unsigned
 * operand occupies [0, 2^64-1], so the same 64-bit pattern denotes a DIFFERENT value than signed i64 for
 * anything ≥ 2^63. That changes three things vs the i64.* ops:
 *   1. range is [0, 2^64-1], not [-2^63, 2^63-1];
 *   2. subtraction underflows at 0 (not at -2^63);
 *   3. div/rem are UNSIGNED — and because operands are kept NON-NEGATIVE bigints, BigInt `/` and `%` are
 *      byte-identical to WASM `i64.div_u` / `i64.rem_u` (no sign-of-dividend remainder, and none of the
 *      signed `INT64_MIN / -1` overflow case exists for unsigned division).
 *
 * Operands and results are `bigint` — a JS `number` cannot represent the u64 range exactly above 2^53,
 * which is the precise fail-open (silent precision loss) that gating scalar UInt64 behind FUNGI-NUMERIC-001
 * guards against. Callers MUST hold in-range, NON-NEGATIVE u64 operands.
 *
 * NOTE (sequencing): this is the arithmetic layer only. It is additive and reachable from nothing yet —
 * UInt64 stays fail-closed under FUNGI-NUMERIC-001 until the interpreter dispatch + gate-lift land. Building
 * and proving the math BEFORE admitting the type is the most-secure order (prove, then lift the gate).
