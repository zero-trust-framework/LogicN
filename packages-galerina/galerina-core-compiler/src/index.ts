// HONEST STATUS (#65 / RD-0130, 2026-06-26). Of this family ONLY SPORE-MEMORY-008
// is WIRED (emitter detectUnsafeBlockWithoutReason; the `unsafe block` construct
// must declare a reason + fallback). SPORE-MEMORY-001..007 are RESERVED / NOT
// EMITTED: no compiler pass produces them and none is planned.
//
// WHY (and why that is correct, not a gap): Galerina is VALUE-SEMANTICS — no shared
// mutable aliasing (a mutated copy never affects its source), no references, no
// raw pointers, no manual malloc/free. The live runtime is a GC tree-walker; the
// production path is WASM (monotonic per-flow bump heap + capability-sandboxed,
// bounds-checked linear memory — no free). So the Rust-borrow-checker bug classes
// these codes name — 001 use-after-move, 002 borrow-after-move, 003
// borrow-escapes-scope, 004 readonly-mutation-through-a-ref, 005 mutable-alias —
// cannot occur by construction. 006 BOUNDS_VIOLATION names a COMPILE-TIME bounds
// proof we do not ship; bounds are enforced at RUNTIME (WASM trap / interpreter
// guard). 007 unchecked-access-outside-unsafe has no scanner (008 covers the
// unsafe-block obligation that matters).
//
// The ONE linear-resource guarantee Galerina genuinely needs — consume-once
// ("a passport used twice") — ships + is enforced as SPORE-AFFINE-001
// (value-state-checker.ts), NOT via these codes. `move`/`borrow`/`pinned` are
// reserved lexer keywords: parsed, currently unenforced.
//
// DO NOT add 001..007 to PRODUCTION_BLOCKERS (production-check.ts): a blocker no
// pass can emit is a FALSE capability claim (RD-0124; enforced by
// scripts/audit-production-blockers.mjs, and the phase29 reserved-codes tripwire).
// Re-classify one as live ONLY if Galerina ever gains shared mutable references AND
// a real detector is wired. They stay defined (namespace stability — the
// catalog/registry/expected-diagnostics reference them), not deleted. Canonical
// stance: docs/Knowledge-Bases/galerina-memory-safety-model.md.
