/**
 * governance-mode.ts — the `full | auto | lean` governance ladder resolver (JOB 0011, parts b+c).
 *
 * This is the PURE decision core of the graduated-governance feature: given a flow's
 * effect/taint facts plus the project default and the flow's requested mode, it resolves the
 * runtime governance tier. It performs NO execution and grants NO authority — it only LABELS a
 * flow `full` or `lean`. Nothing acts on the label yet; the parser token (a), the
 * `governanceMode` manifest field (d), and the AOT-`lean`-to-WASM router (e) are separate,
 * later wiring (e is gated behind the fidelity differential harness).
 *
 * MONOTONE-SAFETY (the security invariant, proved by construction):
 *   resolveGovernanceMode(...).tier === "lean"  ⟹  (effectFree ∧ taintClean)
 * `lean` is *erasure of enforcement that was compiler-proved unnecessary*, never a relaxation
 * of an enforcement that exists. A flow with any declared/inferred effect, or any
 * secret/PII/embedding taint reaching a sink, can NEVER resolve to `lean` — it is forced to
 * `full`. So lowering governance can never flip Deny→Allow or launder taint past a floor:
 * `lean ⊆ EffectFree ∧ taint-clean`, and the floors are defined on effects/taint, so the
 * intersection of "nothing to enforce" with "the floors" is empty.
 *
 * Design: docs/Knowledge-Bases/galerina-governance-mode-ladder.md (R&D job 0011).
