// =============================================================================
// Galerina — Security Policy Constants and Anti-Abuse Architecture
//
// Implements the anti-abuse protections from:
//   docs/Knowledge-Bases/galerina-security-anti-abuse.md
//
// Key protections:
//   process.spawn as a declared effect (ungoverned background workers → blocked)
//   network destination policy (allowlist + deny private_ranges)
//   FUNGI-NET-001/002 (destination denied, SSRF/private-range access)
//
// Phase 25D: constants and types.
// Phase 26: wiring enforcement into capability host + interpreter.
// =============================================================================

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// New effect names for anti-abuse

 *
 * process.spawn — any background worker, cron task, child process, or worker thread.

 *
 * network.destination — used with contract.network { allow host ... deny wildcard ... }

 *   Without network.destination declared, only allow/deny at outbound level.
