// TestWitness (RD-0128, note 67) — a deterministic, signable receipt binding a wasm artifact to its
// governance leak proof + contract-test-suite digest. These tests pin the ZT-critical properties:
// the vouch predicate is DENY-BY-DEFAULT (a leak / tampered / wrong-artifact witness never vouches),
// the canonical pre-image is deterministic + tamper-evident (so the out-of-band signature catches edits),
// and the suite digest is order-independent but change-sensitive.
