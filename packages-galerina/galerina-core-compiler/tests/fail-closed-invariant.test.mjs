/**
 * GLOBAL fail-closed invariant suite (2026-06-19) — the standard guard against trap-discard fail-OPENs.
 *
 * Invariant: a checked-operation trap (i32 overflow, division-by-zero, …) MUST fail the flow closed
 * (a runtimeError result) REGARDLESS of where its result lands — on the return path, assigned to a
 * never-returned binding, or discarded inside a loop. A trap is a FAILURE, not a discardable value.
 *
 * Why this exists: the i32-overflow fail-open (R&D 0038) — `junk = 2e9 * 2e9` where `junk` is never
 * returned silently COMPLETED (the overflow's runtimeError was dropped). FIXED 2026-06-19: a CHECKED-OP
 * trap (IntegerOverflow / DivisionByZero) now propagates out of a binding/expression statement
 * (`isCheckedTrap` in interpreter.ts) so it fails the flow closed regardless of result placement. Soft
 * runtimeErrors (e.g. a missing field) keep value semantics so graceful handling still works. All cases
 * below now PASS and are permanent guards against this CLASS (any checked op × any result placement).
