/**
 * FUNGI-TIER-001 / FUNGI-VALUESTATE-008 — CLI-level enforcement through the user-facing galerina.mjs.
 *
 * The effect-checker logic is unit-tested (tier-floor-fungi-tier-001.test.mjs); THIS test proves the
 * WIRING through `galerina.mjs` so a regression in the CLI plumbing (e.g. reverting the production-gated
 * surface/exit, or dropping the dev-mode warning) is caught automatically:
 *   (1) dev `check`            → surfaces FUNGI-TIER-001 + FUNGI-VALUESTATE-008 as WARNINGS, exit 0
 *   (2) production `build`     → FAILS CLOSED (exit 1) on the under-declared tier floor
 *   (3) plain dev `build`      → must NOT trip the production fail-closed floor
