/**
 * Int64 gate-lift REGRESSION GUARD — pins the POST-lift state (owner-gated, 2026-06-25).
 *
 * The Int64 WASM lowering is faithful + proven byte-exact (see wat-i64-differential.test.mjs: walker ≡ WASM
 * over the full (2^53,2^63) corpus), so the `FUNGI-NUMERIC-001` gate was LIFTED for Int64. UInt64 has now ALSO
 * been lifted (#52): the tree-walker carries it as a NON-NEGATIVE bigint via the exact-trapping u64-arith
 * layer, and the WASM emitter DECLINES it (walker-only — unsigned ≠ signed i64). So both 64-bit scalars now
 * compile/build/run faithfully.
 *
 * The crux is a DELIBERATE SET SPLIT that this guard pins:
 *   • BACKEND_UNLOWERABLE_SCALAR  (the FUNGI-NUMERIC-001 GATE)        = { }                          — empty (both lifted)
 *   • FAST_TIER_UNLOWERABLE_SCALAR (the bytecode-VM / sync bail)    = { Int64, UInt64, Decimal }   — all STILL bail
 * The 64-bit widths are admitted by the gate (walker + WASM/u64-walker carry them) yet MUST still route off
 * the i32-only fast tiers, which would silently truncate them. Folding the two sets together would either
 * re-gate a working width or let a fast tier truncate one — both fail-open. This test FAILS LOUDLY if either
 * invariant regresses (a 64-bit width silently re-gated, or the fast-tier bail dropped).
