/**
 * quorum.ts — FAIL-CLOSED distinct-signer M-of-N threshold quorum → K3 verdict.
 *
 * G2 (core half). A sensitive custody action (e.g. unwrapping a sealed key, admitting
 * a high-trust transition) may require the independent approval of M out of N distinct
 * signers. This module is the DECISION: it folds a set of per-signer K3 verdicts into a
 * single three-valued boundary verdict — ALLOW iff at least M *distinct* signers approve.
 *
 * SCOPE — this is governance, not cryptography. It decides WHETHER the threshold is met;
 * it does NOT split or reconstruct any secret. Shamir M-of-N secret-SHARING (the actual
 * share split/combine over key material) is custody EXECUTION and belongs in an external
 * custody package (per the core-declares-verifies / ext-executes split,
 * [[galerina-key-custody-rotation-decision]]). Each `SignerVote.verdict` is expected to be
 * the result of an upstream signature/attestation verification done on binary silicon
 * (FUNGI-SUBSTRATE-001); this primitive treats it as an already-decided trit.
 *
 * Invariants (inherited verbatim from the K3 algebra in three-valued-governance.ts —
 * NOT re-proved here), mirroring lease.ts:
 *  - **Deny-by-default.** Malformed input (a non-integer or < 1 threshold, a non-array
 *    vote set, a vote with an empty signer or an out-of-domain verdict) folds to
 *    INDETERMINATE → denied, audited FUNGI-GOV-3VL-001. There is no path by which bad
 *    input authorizes.
 *  - **Distinct signers only.** Votes are de-duplicated by `signer`; one signer counts
 *    AT MOST once (anti-Sybil — a signer cannot reach the threshold alone by repeating).
 *  - **No equivocation.** A signer that presents two *conflicting* verdicts is a security
 *    anomaly: the whole decision collapses to INDETERMINATE (audited), never silently
 *    dropped — we do not authorize past a detected equivocation.
 *  - **Clean shortfall is a DENY, not an anomaly.** When the input is well-formed but
 *    fewer than M distinct signers approve, the verdict is an ordinary DENY (no
 *    diagnostic) — exactly as an expired (but well-formed) lease is a clean DENY. Only
 *    malformed/equivocating input raises FUNGI-GOV-3VL-001.
 *  - **Pure.** No clock, no I/O, no randomness — same (votes, m) always yields the same
 *    decision (reproducible audit).
