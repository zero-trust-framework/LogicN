/**
 * lease.ts — FAIL-CLOSED TTL capability lease (macaroon-style bounded delegation).
 *
 * G6 slice. A delegated capability must ACTUALLY EXPIRE rather than relying on
 * self-enforcing math: a `CapabilityLease` binds a capability to a hard expiry
 * (`notAfter`) and an `issuedTo` principal, and `checkLease` admits it through the
 * shipped K3 trust boundary so the verdict is three-valued and fail-closed.
 *
 * Invariants (inherited verbatim from the K3 algebra in three-valued-governance.ts —
 * NOT re-proved here):
 *  - **Deny-by-default.** A malformed or absent lease (null/undefined, missing fields,
 *    a non-finite or non-numeric `notAfter`, or a non-finite `now`) folds to
 *    INDETERMINATE → denied (audited FUNGI-GOV-3VL-001). There is no path by which a
 *    bad lease authorizes.
 *  - **Hard expiry.** Once `now >= notAfter` the verdict is DENY. The window is
 *    HALF-OPEN: ALLOW holds iff `now < notAfter` (a lease never outlives, nor is it
 *    valid AT, its own expiry tick).
 *  - **No wall-clock.** `now` is supplied by the caller (a logical tick or ms). This
 *    module reads no clock, so `checkLease` is pure and deterministic — the same
 *    (lease, now) always yields the same decision.
 *  - **Never silent.** An INDETERMINATE collapse carries FUNGI-GOV-3VL-001 in the
 *    decision and to the optional `onDiagnostic` sink. This shapes GOVERNANCE only; it
 *    never touches crypto (lease integrity, if signed, is verified upstream on binary
 *    silicon — out of scope here).
