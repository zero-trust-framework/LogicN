/**
 * deadzone-dispatcher.ts — executes the author-declared `on_indeterminate` K3 dead-zone policy.
 *
 * A substrate reading that discretizes to the K3-0 INDETERMINATE dead zone (a voted result of 0 — phase
 * drift / lane failure into the ambiguous band) is governed by the flow's declared
 * `substrate { on_indeterminate: trap | revote:N | fallback_digital }` policy. The compiler PARSES that
 * policy (substrate-inference.ts) but, until now, NOTHING executed it at the runtime read path — the
 * INDETERMINATE simply propagated (collapsing to deny via vAnd, which is fail-safe, but the author's
 * declared disposition — re-vote harder, or take the exact digital value — was silently IGNORED). This
 * module executes the declared policy, fail-closed: an unresolved dead zone always TRAPS, never a guessed
 * value. (Owner-approved build 2026-06-25; the parsed-but-dead policy is now enforced at runtime.)
