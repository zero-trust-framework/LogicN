/**
 * hybrid-engine.ts — The Unified Hybrid Inference Engine
 *
 * ONE bespoke engine that blends the best of three open-source engines inside a
 * single governed inference pass:
 *
 *   BitNet (ternary)  +  NVFP4 (fp4 block)  +  Groq LPU (static schedule)
 *
 * It is NOT a router that dispatches a whole request to one of three backends.
 * It is a single engine whose internal operations each run the technique best
 * suited to that operation — and every choice is recorded in the AuditEvent
 * ledger so the mixed-precision pass is fully provable after the fact.
 *
 * Governance lifecycle per inference call (LOAD → EXEC → ERASE):
 *   1. LOAD   — sandbox created, artifact hash + correlation ID bound
 *   2. PLAN   — precision router produces a per-op HybridPlan
 *   3. EXEC   — each op dispatched to its technique's kernel (FFI seam)
 *   4. AUDIT  — per-op precision decisions + final receipt → audit log
 *   5. ERASE  — sandbox state wiped (stateless by default)
 *
 * The actual math kernels live in the source repos and are reached through FFI
 * seams (documented below). This module is the GOVERNANCE + ORCHESTRATION layer
 * — the part that is Galerina's distinctive value.
