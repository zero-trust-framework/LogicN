/**
 * substrate-snapshot.ts — calibration-as-attestation core (owner-approved build 2026-06-25).
 *
 * A SubstrateModelSnapshot binds a substrate's noise PARAMETERS to its modeled guarantee. The whole point
 * of "calibration as attestation": the noise figures (pBad / epsilonModeled / met) are STAMPED FROM THE
 * MODEL (`checkGuarantee`), NOT supplied by the author or the hardware — so a producer cannot hand-wave the
 * tolerance down to make a lane "pass". Because `checkGuarantee` is a deterministic, exact function of the
 * parameters, a snapshot is SELF-VERIFYING: `verifySubstrateSnapshot` re-derives the figures and rejects any
 * snapshot whose stamped values diverge (tampered / gamed) — and admits ONLY a consistent snapshot whose
 * guarantee is met (fail-closed). No-Coercion holds: a snapshot can only ever LOWER admissibility, never lift
 * an unmet guarantee into "met".
 *
 * This is the CRYPTO-FREE core (authoritative stamping + consistency re-check). Turning the snapshot into a
 * portable, SIGNED attestation (Ed25519, mirroring bridge-attestation) is a tracked follow-up.
