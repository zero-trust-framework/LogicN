# Galerina Compute TODO

V1 freeze rule: compute planning must keep active target selection to CPU and
WASM. GPU, AI accelerator, optical I/O, photonic, low-bit AI and other advanced
targets are post-v1 planning unless needed to describe core type-system
semantics.

Quantum compute is future/research target planning. It must not be treated as an
active v1 runtime target.
