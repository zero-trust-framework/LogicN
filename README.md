# LogicN

**A governance-first programming language and runtime for high-assurance software.**

LogicN is built for organisations where software failure is not acceptable — financial platforms, healthcare systems, government services, and regulated enterprise. Every execution is **declared, verified, and audited** by design, not by convention.

---

## What LogicN does

**Declares governance in source code.** Every flow declares its intent, effects, capability boundaries, and invariants in a `contract {}` block. The compiler verifies these at build time. There is no runtime surprise.

**Enforces at runtime via the Governed Tower.** The DSS supervisor tracks the V_DPM (Virtual Dynamic Posture Matrix) register — every capability use is a bitmask check, every trap produces a structured AuditEvent, and rollback is clean (`unreachable` fires before the next instruction). *Today this runs as the Stage-A TypeScript simulation; the real `DSS.wasm` component is Post-P9 (#102–106).*

**Produces a cryptographic audit trail.** Every governed execution generates an Epilogue Receipt (sha256_seal or zk_snark). Every security trap appends to an append-only audit log (CBOR Tag 410 AuditEvent). The manifest carrying the governance contract is signed with **Ed25519 today**; *ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) is the planned Stage-B post-quantum upgrade, gated on key custody (#34).*

**Compiles to WebAssembly.** Governance is verified by the compiler's pipeline at build time and enforced on the Stage-A runtime today. Full in-WASM execution enforcement (self-hosting, P9) is *in progress* — the self-hosted `lexer.lln` `tokenize` now achieves **byte-for-byte Stage-A interpreter == Stage-B real-WASM parity** through the #105 admission gate (#143, 2026-06-06); the remaining gate is extending that parity to the parser/type-checker/governance-verifier flows.

## Who it is for

| Sector | Why LogicN |
|---|---|
| **Financial platforms** | Every payment flow declares and enforces its effects. Audit trail by default. PCI DSS governance built in. |
| **Healthcare systems** | PII/PHI is typed and tracked. Redaction is enforced at the type level before data reaches any audit sink. |
| **Government / defence** | Designed for air-gapped deployment, no cloud dependency. BitNet CPU inference for governed AI is in early integration (Inference Tower ~12%). |
| **Enterprise regulated** | OWASP attack vectors blocked at the compiler. Supply-chain provenance via signed manifests (Ed25519 today; ML-DSA-65 post-quantum planned). |

*Stage A (TypeScript Runtime) is the **production-hardened path** — 44/44 packages, 4,129 tests, 0 audit findings.
Stage B (Runtime in LogicN) is **in progress (P9 self-hosting bootstrap)**: the self-hosted lexer/parser/checker `.lln`
sources reach Stage-A == Stage-B parity through the interpreter (R6 corpus, 100%), and the self-hosted `lexer.lln`
`tokenize` now reaches **byte-for-byte Stage-A interpreter == Stage-B real-WASM parity** through the #105 admission
gate (#143, 2026-06-06; `tests/wat-p9-tokenize-parity.test.mjs`). The remaining gate is extending that WASM parity to
the parser/type-checker/governance-verifier flows. Stage B self-hosting is **not yet
100%**; see the roadmap. Honest line: the compiler/runtime/governance engine is production-grade; the framework/app
packages are templates, not implemented.*

**[Intent](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-intent.md)** — The explicit declaration of what a flow is *for*: purpose, effects it may produce, boundaries it must respect. Intent guides optimisation; it does not grant authority. Authority is granted through `contract.effects` and capability declarations.

**[Governed Execution Plan](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-governed-execution-plan.md)** — The compiler-generated operational contract: which capabilities are granted, which effects are allowed, which targets are approved, and which behaviours are explicitly denied.

**[Coordinated Compute](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-coordinated-compute.md)** — The runtime orchestration layer that transforms a governed execution plan into actual execution across CPU, GPU, NPU, APU, WASM and future targets — all within declared authority constraints.

**[Audit Proof](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-audit-proof.md)** — The structured, verifiable runtime evidence that execution occurred within declared authority. Not logs — cryptographically signed, provable evidence.

---

## What LogicN Is

LogicN is three things building toward one platform:

**1. A language** — strict typing, explicit errors, declared effects, no hidden nulls, no silent failures. Source files use `.lln`.

**2. A compiler and checker pipeline** — lexer → parser → type checker → value-state/taint checker → effect checker → governance verifier → GIR emitter → tiered runtime. Every check has a diagnostic code. **4,145 tests, 0 failures**. Stage B self-hosting is **in progress (P9)** — Stage-A == Stage-B interpreter parity is locked (R6 corpus) and `tokenize` WASM byte-parity is **achieved** (#143); extending WASM parity to the parser/type-checker/governance-verifier flows is the remaining gate.

**3. A governed runtime architecture** — capability-based authority, machine-readable ProofGraph, post-quantum governance signatures, PCI DSS 4.0.1 audit, Deterministic Runtime Containment Model (DRCM) with monotonic security overlays.

### What makes it different

| Traditional | LogicN |
|---|---|
| Errors as exceptions | Explicit `Result<T, E>` — no silent failure |
| Mutation is silent | `let` = immutable · `mut` = explicit · `readonly` = view |
| Side-effects hidden | Effects declared: `contract { effects { database.write } }` |
| Boundary data silently typed | `unsafe let raw` — untrusted until gated |
| AI guesses at structure | Machine-readable ProofGraph + intent manifests |
| Security checked at runtime | Compile-time: taint, secrets, PCI DSS, governance proofs |
| Fixed hardware | Declared targets: CPU · WASM · GPU · NPU · APU · Photonic |

## Code Examples

> **LogicN three-block structure:** every flow has up to three outer blocks:
> 1. `flow name(params) -> ReturnType` — signature
> 2. `contract { ... }` — compile-time governance declaration (outside the body, not inside it)
> 3. `policy { ... }` — runtime monotonic overlay (optional, DRCM Phase 4)
> 4. `{ body }` — the runtime code
>
> `contract {}` and `policy {}` are **separate blocks**, not nested. Most flows only need `contract {}` and `{ body }`.

```logicn
// ── Governed secure flow: PII handling ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// contract {} is OUTSIDE the body braces — it is a compile-time declaration.
// The compiler reads it before any code runs, verifies intent against effects,
// builds the ProofGraph, and enforces data-flow rules.
//
// Anatomy:
//   secure flow name(params) -> ReturnType    ← signature
//   contract { ... }                          ← compile-time governance declaration
//   {                                         ← body opens here
//     ...runtime code...
//   }

secure flow createPatient(readonly request: Request) -> CreatePatientResult
contract {
  types   { type CreatePatientResult = Result<Response, ApiError> }
  intent  { "Create a patient record with protected PII handling." }
  effects { database.write  audit.write }
  privacy { contains PII  require redaction before audit.write }
}
{
  unsafe let rawEmail: String = request.body.email
  let email: protected Email  = validate.email(rawEmail)?
  let saved = PatientsDB.insert({ email: email })?
  AuditLog.write({ event: "PatientCreated", patientId: saved.id, email: redact(email) })
  return Ok(Response.created(saved.id))
}


// ── Pure flow: zero side effects, compiler-proved ────────────────────────────
pure flow calculateVat(price: Money<GBP>) -> Money<GBP>
contract { intent { "Calculate 20% VAT on a GBP price." } }
{
  return price * Decimal("0.20")
}


// ── Match: exhaustive by default ─────────────────────────────────────────────
pure flow describeStatus(s: Status) -> String
contract { intent { "Map a status enum to a display string." } }
{
  match s {
    Active    => { return "live" }
    Suspended => { return "paused" }
    Deleted   => { return "removed" }
  }
}


// ── Secrets: vault-backed, never in plaintext ─────────────────────────────────
// contract.secrets {} is auto-by-default (uses .env).
// Declare only when vault/KMS rotation is needed.
secure flow charge(amount: Int) -> Result<Int, String>
contract {
  intent  { "Charge a customer using a vault-backed API key." }
  effects { audit.write  network.outbound }
  secrets {
    credential payment_key { provider "hashicorp_vault"  path "secret/data/payment" }
    rotation { interval 1h  strategy smooth_handshake  on_rotation_fault halt }
  }
}
{
  AuditLog.write("Charge initiated")
  return Ok(amount)
}
```

## Architecture Patterns

LogicN has nine canonical patterns. Patterns 1–6 compile today (`drcm_stable_v0`). Patterns 7–9 require DRCM phases (marked `drcm_core_v1`). Each has a verified `.lln` example in `tests/patterns/`.

| # | Pattern | Profile | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Pure Transform](tests/patterns/pattern-01-pure-transform.lln) | stable | Math, string transforms, data mapping — no I/O, no side effects |
| 2 | [Governed API Route](tests/patterns/pattern-02-governed-api-route.lln) | stable | HTTP routes, webhooks, event handlers — external ingress |
| 3 | [High-Trust Mutation](tests/patterns/pattern-03-high-trust-mutation.lln) | stable | Payments, medical records, government data — full contract |
| 4 | [Cross-Boundary Workflow](tests/patterns/pattern-04-cross-boundary-interim.lln) | stable | External APIs / third-party calls — uses `security.interim` until `step` ships |
| 5 | [Secret-Using Flow](tests/patterns/pattern-05-secret-using-flow.lln) | stable | Any flow that reads a credential — `secrets {}` + `SecureString` taint guards |
| 6 | [Multi-Tier Service](tests/patterns/pattern-06-multi-tier-service.lln) | stable | API → business logic → data layer — three separate governed flows |
| 7 | [Governed WASM Module](tests/patterns/pattern-07-governed-wasm-module.lln) | `drcm_core_v1` | DRCM Phase 5 — DSS supervision, DWI isolates, fuel injection |
| 8 | [Emergency Policy Overlay](tests/patterns/pattern-08-emergency-policy.lln) | `drcm_core_v1` | DRCM Phase 4 — auto-tightening `policy { emergency { ... } }` |
| 9 | [.lmanifest Compliance](tests/patterns/pattern-09-lmanifest.md) | `drcm_core_v1` | DRCM Phase 3 — machine-verifiable compliance artifact for PCI DSS / SOC 2 |
