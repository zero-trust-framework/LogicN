# LogicN

**A governance-first programming language and runtime for high-assurance software.**

LogicN is built for organisations where software failure is not acceptable — financial platforms, healthcare systems, government services, and regulated enterprise. Every execution is **declared, verified, and audited** by design, not by convention.

> **Maturity (honest status, 2026-06-23).** LogicN is an **advanced prototype with several hardened zero-trust subsystems** — *not* yet a production-complete platform. The **compiler, security, and governance core are production-grade** (53/53 packages, 5,042 tests, fail-closed border check). The **application-framework layer is now substantially real**: the deny-by-default admission/fusion border (3 gates + multi-module linker + revocation), the `logicn new app` scaffolder, and the governed package resolver are shipped and tested (87 App-Kernel tests). The **governed HTTP transport (B8) is unlocked and in progress** — the TLSTP **S1 K3 cert/channel-validation gate** landed (`logicn-core-network`, 126 tests, fail-closed `revocation-unknown → DENY`), though it is not yet wired into the live kernel auth path; the *servable api-server / example-app* and the *signed registry index* are the remaining framework gaps. Stage-B self-hosting is in progress (≈80%), and the "Tower" compute layer is a **governed software simulator + bridge-attestation runtime, not real photonic-CPU virtualisation**. See [the 2026-06-23 EOD roadmap + % audit](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-roadmap-and-percent-audit-2026-06-23-eod.md) and [the framework plan](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-framework-plan-2026-06-21.md).

## The Zero-Trust thesis

LogicN optimises for **mathematical proof and absolute Zero-Trust containment**: an ecosystem that trusts **absolutely no one — not the developer, not the network, not the host OS.** Where most languages bolt security on as a library, LogicN treats **every boundary as already hostile** and *proves* the boundary at compile time. Each row below is a boundary and the mandate LogicN enforces at it.

| Boundary | LogicN's mandate | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Compiler** | Verifies your **pre-resolved policy + execution DAG** strictly for deterministic, mathematically reproducible correctness — the contract is proven at build time, so there is no runtime surprise. | ✅ shipped |
| **I/O — the OS kernel** | Assumes the kernel is *already a compromised, hostile environment*. Native capabilities are **denied by default**; the host is a **dumb byte-mover**; authorisation is the fail-closed **`vAnd` Kleene-K3 gate** — never OS-level I/O injected into a `main`. | ◑ K3 gate shipped · full bypass = design intent |
| **Packages** | A **signed central registry** with fail-closed kernel verification: cryptographic manifests, content-addressed **hash-pinning**, and transitive **capability masks**. | ✅ admission shipped |
| **Memory** | An actively-governed, **hostile physical boundary**. Standard shared-mutable memory models are **mathematically incompatible** with absolute Zero-Trust invariants — so TLSTP governs network memory *directly* instead of handing it to shared host state. | ◑ governed · real isolation = design intent |
| **TLSTP — zero-middleware** | Routes *around* the OS kernel: the host writes raw encrypted packets as **unparsed byte-arrays** straight into WASM linear memory; **decryption happens strictly inside the WASM sandbox** — the kernel never sees plaintext. | ◑ design intent (DSS.wasm TCB #102-106) |

> **Honest line — shipped vs. design intent.** The **compiler**, the **`vAnd` Kleene-K3 authorisation gate**, **signed package admission** (hash-pin · signature · revocation · closed capabilities), and the **S1 cert/channel-validation gate** are **shipped and tested today**. The full **kernel-bypass / in-sandbox isolation** — decryption inside a *real* WASM sandbox with the host as a pure byte-mover — is the **target architecture**, gated on the real `DSS.wasm` Wasmtime TCB (#102–106, still a stub; a design-spec is in R&D). Treat kernel-bypass / zero-middleware as **design intent**, not yet a shipped runtime property.

---

## What LogicN does

**Declares governance in source code.** Every flow declares its intent, effects, capability boundaries, and invariants in a `contract {}` block. The compiler verifies these at build time. There is no runtime surprise.

**Enforces at runtime via the Governed Tower.** The DSS supervisor tracks the V_DPM (Virtual Dynamic Posture Matrix) register — every capability use is a bitmask check, every trap produces a structured AuditEvent, and rollback is clean (`unreachable` fires before the next instruction). *Today this runs as the Stage-A TypeScript simulation; the real `DSS.wasm` component is Post-P9 (#102–106).*

**Produces a cryptographic audit trail.** Every governed execution generates an Epilogue Receipt (sha256_seal or zk_snark). Every security trap appends to an append-only audit log (CBOR Tag 410 AuditEvent). **Hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204) signing is shipped** on the attestation, proof-graph, and bridge surfaces (both halves required — no post-quantum downgrade; certified mode *mandates* the ML-DSA key). The `.lmanifest` itself is still **Ed25519-only**, with the hybrid upgrade gated on production key custody (#34/#149).

**Compiles to WebAssembly.** Governance is verified by the compiler at build time and enforced on the Stage-A runtime today. **WASM is the production execution path** — independently benchmarked as native-class (see Benchmarks). Full in-WASM self-hosting (P9) is *in progress*: the self-hosted `lexer.lln` `tokenize` reaches **byte-for-byte Stage-A == Stage-B real-WASM parity** (#143); extending that to the parser/type-checker/governance-verifier flows is the remaining gate.

## Who it is for

| Sector | Why LogicN |
|---|---|
| **Financial platforms** | Every payment flow declares and enforces its effects. Audit trail by default. PCI DSS governance built in (`logicn-devtools-pci`). |
| **Healthcare systems** | PII/PHI is typed and tracked. Redaction is enforced at the type level before data reaches any audit sink. |
| **Government / defence** | Designed for air-gapped deployment, no cloud dependency. Governed BitNet CPU inference is in early integration (Inference Tower ~12%). |
| **Enterprise regulated** | OWASP attack vectors blocked at the compiler. Supply-chain provenance via signed manifests (Ed25519 today; hybrid ML-DSA-65 on the attestation/bridge surfaces). |

## Benchmarks (measured 2026-06-23 — honest numbers)

Run on an **Intel i9-9900K (8C/16T) + NVIDIA RTX 2060**, across Rust (native, generic + AVX2), Node.js (V8), Python (CPython), LogicN's WASM output, the Stage-A interpreter tiers, and real GPU (Deno WebGPU). Harness at `packages-logicn/logicn-devtools-benchmarks`; quote the canonical **§1.5 production-ceiling scoreboard** from `npm run compare` (the standard view — the 3 diagnostic `⟨interp⟩` tiers cannot "win", and the only honest LogicN cost is the shipping **WASM ▶ production** path).

**The production-ceiling scoreboard (WASM ▶ production vs the fastest real runtime):**

- **WASM ▶ production won outright** on `hardware-targets` (1st/4) and `fibonacci-recursive` (1st/5), and lands **~2.0–3.6× the winner** on most hot compute (`record-allocation` 2.0×, `six-digit-guess` 2.0×, `gpu-compute` 2.3×, `matrix-multiply` 3.6× behind the RTX-2060). Winner tally across the comparable set: Node.js 5 · Rust AVX2 5 · Rust (generic) 5 · **WASM ▶ production 2** · Deno-WebGPU 1.
- **Governance is not free, stated honestly:** `governance-cost` is the heavy outlier at **293×** the AVX2 winner (the per-decision K3 fold), and `collection-pipeline` is 61× — these are the cost of compiling governance *into* the binary; on the per-flow `Node/LogicN` view governed overhead is ~**24.6%**.
- **The Stage-A `⟨interp⟩` tiers are diagnostic, not the product** — they are the WASM byte-parity oracle and are *excluded from winning* by the scoreboard standard (they can read 1.0K–1025K× slower and that is expected).
- **`tmf-container`** is now benchmarked (Rust 161.5K/s, Node 46.4K/s). `tri-logic` and `data-query` are **excluded — not unit-aligned** (R&D 0092, no silent caps).

intent  →  governed execution plan  →  coordinated compute  →  audit proof
```

**[Intent](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-intent.md)** — what a flow is *for*: purpose, allowed effects, boundaries. Intent guides optimisation; authority is granted through `contract.effects` and capability declarations.
**[Governed Execution Plan](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-governed-execution-plan.md)** — the compiler-generated operational contract: capabilities granted, effects allowed, targets approved, behaviours denied.
**[Coordinated Compute](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-coordinated-compute.md)** — runtime orchestration across CPU/GPU/NPU/WASM and future targets, within declared authority.
**[Audit Proof](docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-audit-proof.md)** — structured, cryptographically signed runtime evidence that execution stayed within declared authority.

## What makes it different

| Traditional | LogicN |
|---|---|
| Errors as exceptions | Explicit `Result<T, E>` — no silent failure |
| Mutation is silent | `let` = immutable · `mut` = explicit · `readonly` = view |
| Side-effects hidden | Effects declared: `contract { effects { database.write } }` |
| Boundary data silently typed | `unsafe let raw` — untrusted until gated |
| AI guesses at structure | Machine-readable ProofGraph + intent manifests |
| Security checked at runtime | Compile-time: taint, secrets, PCI DSS, governance proofs |
| Fixed hardware | Declared targets: CPU · WASM · GPU · NPU · Photonic |

---

## Code Examples

> **Three-block structure:** `flow name(params) -> ReturnType` (signature) · `contract { ... }` (compile-time governance, *outside* the body) · optional `policy { ... }` (runtime monotonic overlay) · `{ body }`. `contract {}` and `policy {}` are separate blocks, not nested.

```logicn
// ── Governed secure flow: PII handling ───────────────────────────────────────
secure flow createPatient(readonly request: Request) -> CreatePatientResult
contract {
  types   { type CreatePatientResult = Result<Response, ApiError> }
  intent  { "Create a patient record with protected PII handling." }
  effects { database.write  audit.write }
  privacy { contains PII  require redaction before audit.write }
}
{
  unsafe let rawEmail: String = request.body.email
  let email: protected Email  = validate.email(rawEmail)?
  let saved = PatientsDB.insert({ email: email })?
  AuditLog.write({ event: "PatientCreated", patientId: saved.id, email: redact(email) })
  return Ok(Response.created(saved.id))
}

// ── Pure flow: zero side effects, compiler-proved ────────────────────────────
pure flow calculateVat(price: Money<GBP>) -> Money<GBP>
contract { intent { "Calculate 20% VAT on a GBP price." } }
{
  return price * Decimal("0.20")
}

// ── Match: exhaustive by default ─────────────────────────────────────────────
pure flow describeStatus(s: Status) -> String
contract { intent { "Map a status enum to a display string." } }
{
  match s {
    Active    => { return "live" }
    Suspended => { return "paused" }
    Deleted   => { return "removed" }
  }
}
```

## Architecture Patterns

Nine canonical patterns. Patterns 1–6 compile today (`drcm_stable_v0`); 7–9 require DRCM phases (`drcm_core_v1`). Each has a verified `.lln` example in `tests/patterns/`.

| # | Pattern | Profile | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pure Transform | stable | Math, string transforms — no I/O |
| 2 | Governed API Route | stable | HTTP routes, webhooks — external ingress |
| 3 | High-Trust Mutation | stable | Payments, medical, government data |
| 4 | Cross-Boundary Workflow | stable | External APIs — `security.interim` until `step` ships |
| 5 | Secret-Using Flow | stable | Reads a credential — `secrets {}` + taint guards |
| 6 | Multi-Tier Service | stable | API → business → data, three governed flows |
| 7 | Governed WASM Module | `drcm_core_v1` | DRCM Phase 5 — DSS supervision, DWI isolates |
| 8 | Emergency Policy Overlay | `drcm_core_v1` | DRCM Phase 4 — auto-tightening `policy {}` |
| 9 | .lmanifest Compliance | `drcm_core_v1` | DRCM Phase 3 — PCI DSS / SOC 2 artifact |

## Building an application

A LogicN app is **compile-time conventions + signed governed packages fused at declared seams — not runtime middleware.** Scaffold one with `logicn new app`:

```text
my-orders-app/
├── App.lln          composition-root flow (the app entry)
├── App.manifest     declarative descriptor → folded into the SIGNED build/App.lmanifest
├── flows/           your governed business logic (routeOrders, createOrder, …)
├── deps/            signed governed components admitted at the fuse border
├── proofs/          contract-driven generated tests
└── .gitignore       build/ output + .env secrets are never committed
```

`logicn build App.lln` produces **one signed `build/App.wasm` + `build/App.lmanifest`** (Ed25519). A host **App Kernel** admits that wasm at a deny-by-default **fuse border** — three fail-closed gates — before it runs a single instruction:

1. **hash-pin** — the `.wasm` sha256 must equal the signed descriptor.
2. **signature + revocation** — a valid Ed25519 signature from a **non-revoked** key.
3. **closed capabilities** — a declared capability with no host shim is refused (link-time `LinkError → CRITICAL_SECURITY_VIOLATION`).

At runtime the app reaches the world **only** through the deny-by-default **Capability Host** (network · db · secrets), with governance — K3, contracts, fail-closed, audit — **compiled into** the wasm rather than wrapped around it. Capability binding lives in the signed `.lmanifest fuse{}` block; `.env` secrets are injected at runtime, never compiled in.
