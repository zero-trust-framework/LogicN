# LogicN Security Model

This document describes the proposed security model for **LogicN / LogicN**.

LogicN is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and accelerator-aware programming language concept.

Security in LogicN should be part of the language, compiler, runtime, package system, build process and deployment model.

---

## Security Model Summary

LogicN should be secure by default.

The security model should protect against:

```text
unsafe memory
silent null values
undefined values
unhandled errors
implicit type coercion
truthy/falsy mistakes
unsafe JSON payloads
unverified webhooks
secret leakage
unsafe dependency behaviour
unsafe target fallback
compiled-in secrets
unsafe source-map exposure
```

The goal is not to make all software automatically secure.

The goal is to make safe code easier to write and unsafe code harder to write.

---

## Core Security Rule

The core rule is:

```text
Safe by default.
Explicit when risky.
Reported when changed.
Source-mapped when broken.
```

---

## Default Security Profile

A new LogicN project should begin with strong defaults.

Example:

```LogicN
security {
  memory_safe true
  strict_types true
  null "deny"
  undefined "deny"
  unsafe "deny"
  unhandled_errors "deny"
  implicit_casts "deny"
  truthy_falsy "deny"
  secret_logging "deny"
  source_maps true
}
```

---

## No Undefined

LogicN should not include JavaScript-style `undefined`.

Invalid:

```LogicN
let value = undefined
```

Use:

```LogicN
Option<T>
```

Example:

```LogicN
let customer: Option<Customer> = findCustomer(customerId)

match customer {
  Some(c) => processCustomer(c)
  None    => return Review("Customer missing")
}
```

---

## No Silent Null

LogicN should avoid silent null behaviour.

Missing values should be explicit.

Use:

```LogicN
Option<T>
```

Not:

```text
Customer | null | undefined
```

If JSON contains `null`, LogicN should decode it into `Option<T>` where aLOwed.

---

## Explicit Errors

LogicN should use explicit error handling.

Use:

```LogicN
Result<T, Error>
```

Example:

```LogicN
flow loadOrder(id: OrderId) -> Result<Order, OrderError> {
  let order: Option<Order> = database.findOrder(id)

  match order {
    Some(o) => return Ok(o)
    None    => return Err(OrderError.NotFound)
  }
}
```

Unhandled `Result` values should fail compilation or produce strong warnings.

---

## Strict Types

LogicN should reject implicit type coercion.

Invalid:

```LogicN
let total = "10" + 5
```

Valid:

```LogicN
let total: Int = toInt("10") + 5
```

Strict typing helps prevent:

```text
payment bugs
JSON bugs
API bugs
security decision bugs
date/time bugs
currency bugs
target compatibility bugs
```

---

## No Truthy / Falsy Logic

Only `Bool` should be used in boolean conditions.

Invalid:

```LogicN
if customer {
  process(customer)
}
```

Valid:

```LogicN
match customer {
  Some(c) => process(c)
  None    => return Review("Customer missing")
}
```

This avoids mistakes common in loosely typed languages.

---

## Memory Safety

LogicN should be memory safe by default.

The language should protect against:

```text
buffer overflows
use-after-free
double free
dangling references
out-of-bounds access
uninitialised memory
unsafe shared mutation
data races
null pointer errors
```

Normal LogicN code should not use raw pointers.

Unsafe behaviour should be denied by default.

---

## Unsafe Code

Default:

```LogicN
security {
  unsafe "deny"
}
```

If unsafe code is ever supported, it should be:

```text
explicit
auditable
source-mapped
permission-checked
reported in security reports
blocked in strict profiles
```

Possible future syntax:

```LogicN
unsafe flow callNativeLibrary()
permissions [native_bindings] {
  ...
}
```

---

## SecureString

Secrets should use:

```LogicN
SecureString
```

`SecureString` is a migration alias for `String secure`. Both forms are accepted. New code should prefer the postfix state form (see below).

Example:

```LogicN
let apiKey: SecureString = env.secret("API_KEY")
```

Rules:

```text
SecureString cannot be printed by default
SecureString cannot be logged by default
SecureString cannot be accidentally converted to String
SecureString should be redacted in reports
SecureString should be cleared from memory where possible
```

Invalid:

```LogicN
print(apiKey)
```

Valid:

```LogicN
log.info("API key loaded", { key: redact(apiKey) })
```

---

## Postfix Type State Syntax

LogicN uses postfix type state to express security and validation status directly on values, without requiring separate wrapper types.

The syntax is: base type first, governance state second.

```LogicN
String unsafe          // untrusted external input
String safe            // confirmed trusted
Email safe validated   // validated and safe
Json unsafe            // raw boundary data, not yet checked
```

This replaces the older prefix qualifier style (`unsafe String`, `safe Email`).

### v1 State Set

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `safe` | Confirmed trusted within this context |
| `unsafe` | Untrusted — requires validation before use |
| `validated` | Has passed a validation gate |
| `unvalidated` | Has not yet passed a validation gate |

States compose:

```LogicN
Email safe validated   // safe AND validated
Json unsafe unvalidated // unsafe AND not yet validated
```

### Security Relevance

Postfix state makes trust boundaries visible at the type level:

```LogicN
flow handleRequest(body: Json unsafe) -> Result<Order, ValidationError> {
  let parsed: CreateOrderRequest safe validated =
    attempt validate.json<CreateOrderRequest>(body)
    else error ValidationError.InvalidBody

  return processOrder(parsed)
}
```

The compiler enforces that `unsafe` values cannot pass into flows that require `safe` or `validated` state without a gate call.

### Relation to SecureString

`String secure` is the postfix form of `SecureString`. The compiler treats both identically. `SecureString` remains supported as a convenience alias.

```LogicN
let apiKey: String secure = env.secret("API_KEY")   // preferred
let apiKey: SecureString = env.secret("API_KEY")     // alias, also valid
```

The full postfix type state specification is documented in
`docs/Knowledge-Bases/postfix-type-state-syntax.md`.

---

## Secrets Outside Compiled Files

LogicN should never compile real secrets into output files.

Do not put secrets inside:

```text
app.bin
app.wasm
app.gpu.plan
app.photonic.plan
app.ternary.sim
app.omni-logic.sim
```

Use:

```text
.env for local development
server environment variables
container secrets
cloud secrets managers
deployment platform secrets
```

Rule:

```text
Compiled files are not secret.
Secrets live outside compiled files.
```

---

## Environment Access

Environment access should be explicit.

Example:

```LogicN
let port: Int = env.int("APP_PORT", default: 8080)
let apiKey: SecureString = env.secret("API_KEY")
```

Accessing environment variables should be controlled by permissions.

Example:

```LogicN
permissions {
  environment "restricted"
}
```

---

## Permission Model

LogicN should support project-level permissions.

Example:

```LogicN
permissions {
  network "restricted"
  file_read "aLOw"
  file_write "restricted"
  environment "restricted"
  native_bindings "deny"
}
```

Permissions may apply to:

```text
network access
file reads
file writes
database access
environment access
secret access
native bindings
external processes
package behaviour
```

---

## Package Permissions

Packages should declare the permissions they need.

Example:

```LogicN
package_policy {
  aLOw_network false
  aLOw_file_write false
  aLOw_native false
  aLOw_unsafe false
}
```

The package manager should warn when a dependency asks for risky permissions.

Example warning:

```text
Package logicn-http-client requests network.outbound permission.
Review before aLOwing.
```

---

## Effect System

LogicN should include an effect system.

Effects show what a flow can do.

Example pure flow:

```LogicN
pure flow calculateTax(amount: Money<GBP>) -> Money<GBP> {
  return amount * 0.20
}
```

A pure flow must not:

```text
read files
write files
use network
read environment variables
read time
generate random numbers
change global state
```

Example effectful flow:

```LogicN
flow sendEmail(email: Email) -> Result<Void, EmailError>
effects [network.external] {
  return mailer.send(email)
}
```

---

## JSON Security

LogicN should be JSON-native but strict.

Preferred:

```LogicN
let input: CreateOrderRequest = json.decode<CreateOrderRequest>(req.body)
```

ALOwed when needed:

```LogicN
let raw: Json = req.json()
let eventType: String = raw.path("$.type").asString()
```

Production code should prefer typed JSON decoding.

---

## JSON Safety Policy

LogicN should support JSON safety limits.

Example:

```LogicN
json_policy {
  max_body_size 1mb
  max_depth 32
  duplicate_keys "deny"
  unknown_fields "warn"
  null_fields "deny"
  date_format "iso8601"
}
```

This protects against:

```text
oversized payloads
deep nesting attacks
duplicate key ambiguity
unexpected null
missing fields
wrong types
unsafe number conversion
date parsing ambiguity
schema drift
```

---

## API Security

API routes should be explicit and typed.

Example:

```LogicN
api OrdersApi {
  POST "/orders" {
    request CreateOrderRequest
    response CreateOrderResponse
    errors [ValidationError, PaymentError]
    timeout 5s
    max_body_size 1mb
    handler createOrder
  }
}
```

API security should include:

```text
typed request bodies
typed response bodies
timeouts
payload size limits
rate limiting
safe error responses
structured logging
safe JSON validation
```

---

## Webhook Security

Webhooks should be secure by default.

A webhook should usually include:

```text
HMAC verification
secret from environment
max age
max body size
replay protection
idempotency key
handler
```

Example:

```LogicN
webhook PaymentWebhook {
  path "/webhooks/payment"
  method POST

  security {
    hmac_header "Payment-Signature"
    secret env.secret("PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET")
    max_age 5m
    max_body_size 512kb
    replay_protection true
  }

  idempotency_key json.path("$.id")
  handler handlePaymentWebhook
}
```

---

## Idempotency

Idempotency prevents duplicate processing.

This matters for:

```text
webhooks
payment captures
order creation
refunds
stock reservation
external API calls
```

Example:

```LogicN
idempotency_key json.path("$.id")
```

The runtime should detect repeated keys and avoid repeating unsafe side effects.

---

## Replay Protection

Webhook replay protection should include:

```text
signature verification
timestamp validation
maximum event age
idempotency key
duplicate detection
body hash verification where useful
```

Old or duplicated webhook events should be rejected or ignored safely.

---

## Rate Limiting

LogicN should support rate limiting for APIs.

Example:

```LogicN
rate_limit {
  requests 100
  window 1m
  overflow "reject"
}
```

Rate limiting protects against:

```text
abuse
brute force attempts
traffic spikes
resource exhaustion
```

---

## Backpressure

Backpressure is a security feature.

Unbounded queues can exhaust memory.

Example:

```LogicN
channel webhooks: Channel<WebhookEvent> {
  buffer 5000
  overflow "dead_letter"
  dead_letter "./storage/dead/webhooks.jsonl"
}
```

Overflow behaviour should always be explicit.

---

## Safe Concurrency

LogicN should prevent data races and unsafe shared mutation.

Concurrency should support:

```text
structured tasks
timeouts
cancellation
safe channels
worker pools
restricted shared state
immutable data by default
```

Shared mutable state should require explicit protection.

---

## Rollback Security

Rollback should be explicit.

Example:

```LogicN
secure flow completeOrder(order: Order) -> Result<Order, OrderError> {
  checkpoint beforeOrderComplete

  reserveStock(order)
  takePayment(order)
  dispatchOrder(order)

  return Ok(order)

} rollback error {
  restore beforeOrderComplete
  releaseStock(order)
  refundPayment(order)

  return Err(error)
}
```

Important rule:

```text
Rollback should not pretend all side effects are reversible.
```

External actions should declare whether they can be reversed.

---

## Compute Block Security

Compute blocks should only contain accelerator-suitable work.

ALOwed:

```text
pure maths
matrix operations
vector operations
tensor operations
model inference
signal processing
```

Rejected:

```text
file I/O
network I/O
database access
environment secret access
mutable global state
random side effects
```

Invalid:

```LogicN
compute target photonic {
  data = readFile("./data.json")
}
```

Valid:

```LogicN
data = readFile("./data.json")

compute target photonic fallback gpu fallback cpu {
  result = model(data)
}
```

---

## Target Fallback Security

Target fallback must be explicit and reported.

Example:

```LogicN
compute target best {
  prefer photonic
  fallback gpu
  fallback cpu

  score = fraudModel(features)
}
```

The compiler should report:

```text
preferred target
selected target
fallback reason
unsupported operations
precision changes
security implications
```

Fallback must never silently change behaviour.

---

## AI Context Security

AI context files must not contain secret values.

Generated files:

```text
app.ai-context.json
app.ai-context.md
```

ALOwed:

```text
route summaries
type summaries
target summaries
security settings
secret variable names
redacted placeholders
```

Not aLOwed:

```text
API key values
passwords
tokens
private keys
database passwords
webhook secret values
```

---

## `LogicN explain --for-ai` Security

The command:

```bash
LogicN explain --for-ai
```

should produce useful debugging context without leaking secrets.

It should include:

```text
error type
file
line
column
problem
why
suggested fix
safe example
```

It should not include:

```text
real secrets
raw tokens
private keys
full `.env` contents
production data
```

---

## Source Map Security

Source maps are useful but can reveal source structure.

LogicN should support:

```text
debug source maps
release source maps
external source maps
restricted source-map access
source-map stripping
```

Production source maps should usually be stored privately.

Do not expose production source maps publicly unless intentionally reviewed.

---

## Error Reporting Security

Public API errors should not expose internals.

Good public response:

```json
{
  "error": "validation_failed",
  "message": "Request payload is invalid."
}
```

Bad public response:

```json
{
  "error": "src/payment-service.lln:42 DATABASE_PASSWORD failed"
}
```

Detailed source-mapped errors should be internal.

---

## Logging Security

Logs should be structured and redacted.

Bad:

```LogicN
log.info("API key", apiKey)
```

Good:

```LogicN
log.info("API key loaded", { key: redact(apiKey) })
```

`SecureString` should not be loggable unless explicitly redacted.

---

## Dependency Security

LogicN should support supply-chain safety through:

```text
LogicN.lock
dependency hashes
package permissions
licence tracking
native binding warnings
unsafe code warnings
network permission warnings
file write permission warnings
```

The lockfile should include:

```text
package name
version
hash
licence
permissions
target compatibility
```

---

## Plugin Security Architecture

LogicN uses a zero trust plugin model. Every extension package starts with no
permissions and must explicitly declare what it needs. Applications must
explicitly grant those permissions.

Plugin risk levels:

```text
Low risk    — pure computation (LogicN.Math, LogicN.Science): CPU/memory limits
Medium risk — engineering/chemistry: validation rules, simulation isolation
High risk   — AI/Medical/Finance/Robotics: strict sandboxing, audit, human approval gates
```

Permission categories that plugins may request: `safe`, `read`, `write`,
`network`, `execute`, `physical`, `regulated`.

Runtime sandbox layers: compiler validation, runtime sandbox (WASM), capability
tokens, audit logging.

The full plugin security specification is documented in
`docs/Knowledge-Bases/plugin-security-architecture.md`.

---

## Native Binding Security

Native bindings should be denied by default.

Example:

```LogicN
permissions {
  native_bindings "deny"
}
```

If enabled, native bindings should be:

```text
explicit
auditable
permission-checked
source-mapped
included in security reports
```

---

## Kernel and Driver Development

Kernel and driver development is last-stage work and is blocked by default.

It requires explicit maintainer or project permission before design, examples,
compiler support, runtime support, native bindings, backend targets or generated
stubs are added.

Kernel and driver work should wait until LogicN has:

```text
stable language specification
stable memory model
stable security model
stable effect and permission model
native binding policy
target and capability reports
source-map support
audit-friendly diagnostics
```

Blocked unless explicitly approved:

```text
kernel modules
operating-system drivers
privileged runtimes
raw device memory access
raw hardware I/O
vendor SDK driver bindings
direct accelerator driver control
```

Normal LogicN applications should use safe runtime APIs, package permissions and
accelerator planning reports instead of privileged driver access.

---

## Build Security

LogicN should generate build security metadata.

Recommended files:

```text
app.security-report.json
app.build-manifest.json
app.failure-report.json
```

The build manifest should include:

```text
source hash
output hash
dependency hashes
compiler version
build mode
target outputs
created timestamp
```

---

## Deterministic Builds

LogicN should support deterministic builds where possible.

This helps with:

```text
release verification
supply-chain security
auditability
multi-server deployment
rollback
```

---

## Deployment Security

LogicN should support build-once, deploy-many.

Flow:

```text
1. Build once
2. Generate manifest
3. Generate hashes
4. Verify artefact
5. Deploy same artefact to many servers
6. Each server loads its own environment variables
7. Health check
8. Roll back if needed
```

Do not build separately on each server unless necessary.

---

## Decompilation Reality

Compiled output can potentially be reverse engineered.

LogicN may support:

```text
symbol stripping
source-map separation
build signing
checksums
optional obfuscation
```

But the main rule is:

```text
Do not put secrets in compiled output.
```

---

## Security Reports

LogicN should generate:

```text
app.security-report.json
```

The report should include:

```text
security settings
permissions
unsafe usage
secret access
package permissions
webhook security checks
JSON policy checks
API timeout checks
native binding usage
source-map status
target fallback security notes
```

---

## Failure Reports

LogicN should generate:

```text
app.failure-report.json
```

Failure reports should include:

```text
error type
source file
source line
source column
target
build stage
suggested fix
safe example where possible
```

---

## Security Profiles

LogicN may support security profiles.

Possible profiles:

```text
development
strict
production
sandboxed
research
```

### Development

```text
detailed errors
source maps enabled
safe local .env
strict types enabled
unsafe denied
```

### Production

```text
optimised output
secret logging denied
source maps external
debug symbols stripped
strict permissions
runtime config external
```

### Sandboxed

```text
network denied
file write denied
native bindings denied
environment restricted
```

---

## CI Security Checks

LogicN should support security checks in CI.

Example:

```bash
LogicN check --security
LogicN lint --security
LogicN verify build/release/app.build-manifest.json
```

CI should fail if:

```text
unsafe code is introduced
secret logging is detected
webhooks lack verification
API routes lack timeouts
JSON policies are missing
dependencies request risky permissions
target fallback is unsafe
```

---

## Security Non-Goals

LogicN should not claim to make every application secure automatically.

Developers still need:

```text
secure infrastructure
safe deployments
good monitoring
dependency updates
code reviews
secret management
testing
threat modelling
```

LogicN should reduce common mistakes, not remove all responsibility.

---

## Open Security Questions

```text
Should unsafe code exist at all?
Should production source maps be generated by default?
Should package permissions be enforced at compile time or install time?
Should SecureString attempt memory zeroing?
Should LogicN include built-in CSRF support for browser apps?
Should API authentication be a language feature or framework feature?
Should all webhooks require HMAC by default?
Should AI context generation require an explicit flag in production?
```

---

## Final Security Principle

LogicN security should be practical, strict and visible.

The language should make unsafe behaviour:

```text
harder to write
easy to detect
easy to report
easy to trace
easy to reject in CI
```

The best LogicN security model is one where developers can build real JSON/API systems while avoiding common mistakes by default.
