# LogicN Core

LogicN is a governance-first programming language designed to make execution
**explicit, safe, and auditable** — across CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, APUs, TPUs, AI
accelerators, WASM and future heterogeneous hardware. This package is the
language core: syntax rules, type system, effects model, memory ownership model,
diagnostics, and the prototype compiler that makes LogicN runnable today on
Node.js.

## Governance Architecture

LogicN's execution model follows a four-stage semantic pipeline:

```text
intent
    ↓
governed execution plan
    ↓
coordinated compute
    ↓
audit proof
```

**[Intent](../../docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-intent.md)** — The explicit declaration of what a flow or system is *for*: its purpose, the authority it requires, the effects it may produce, the boundaries it must respect, and the outcomes it intends to deliver. Intent is machine-readable, compiler-visible, and enforceable — not documentation.

**[Governed Execution Plan](../../docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-governed-execution-plan.md)** — The compiler/runtime-generated operational contract that defines how execution is *permitted* to occur: which capabilities are granted, which effects are allowed, which resources may be accessed, which runtime targets are approved, and which behaviors are explicitly denied. The bridge between declared intent and actual execution.

**[Coordinated Compute](../../docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-coordinated-compute.md)** — The runtime orchestration layer that transforms a governed execution plan into actual execution across CPU, GPU, NPU, APU, WASM, native and future targets. Responsible for target selection, fallback coordination, memory isolation, accelerator dispatch and runtime verification — all within declared authority constraints.

**[Audit Proof](../../docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-concept-audit-proof.md)** — The structured, verifiable runtime evidence that execution occurred within declared authority, respected governance policy, enforced runtime constraints and satisfied safety guarantees. Not logs — provable evidence.

## Run It Now — No Installation Required

LogicN runs on **Node.js 18+**. The prototype compiler is a plain Node.js
script. No native toolchain, no LLVM, no Rust required.

```bash
cd packages-logicn/logicn-core

# Install dev dependencies
npm install

# Run a .lln file
node compiler/logicn.js run examples/hello.lln

# Check a file for safety errors
node compiler/logicn.js check examples/result.lln

# Run the full example test suite (42 tests)
npm test

# Build all examples and generate reports
npm run build:examples

# Generate AI-readable project context
node compiler/logicn.js ai-context examples --out build/examples

# Verify build artefacts and report status
npm run verify -- build/examples

# Development watch mode
npm run dev
```

---

## Status — Prototype (v0.1-beta)

LogicN is a **language-design and prototype project**. It is not a production
compiler.

The prototype (`compiler/logicn.js`) can:

- Parse and check the documented LogicN v1 subset
- Run simple `.lln` files via Node.js
- Emit scanner-level safety diagnostics (`LLN-MEMORY-*`, `LLN-SAFETY-*`,
  `LLN-BINDING-*`, `LLN-RAWPTR-*`, etc.)
- Generate JSON schema and OpenAPI specs from type declarations
- Emit placeholder build artefacts (`app.bin`, `app.wasm`) with honest
  prototype metadata
- Produce AI-readable context, memory reports, execution reports, source maps
- Run project task automation

The real lexer, parser and AST (Phase 4) are the current build target.

### How it runs today

The prototype compiles LogicN source through a TypeScript/Node.js layer. This
is a deliberate starting point — not a compromise:

```
LogicN Syntax
     ↓  governed checks: types, effects, memory, intent
TypeScript runtime / compiler layer
     ↓  managed language safety
JavaScript output
     ↓  managed runtime semantics
Node.js runtime
     ↓  host APIs, native bridges
V8 JavaScript engine
     ↓  memory-managed execution
C++ native internals
```

Each layer provides its own safety guarantees. LogicN's layer is the most
explicit — ownership, effects, intent declarations — while the layers beneath
contribute managed memory and runtime safety from the JS ecosystem.

The layered memory-safety model at each level:

```
LogicN Syntax      → intended safety model (ownership, effects, intent)
TypeScript         → managed language safety (types, null checks)
JavaScript         → managed runtime semantics (GC, bounds)
Node.js            → host runtime, APIs, native bridges
V8                 → memory-managed JS engine
C++                → native implementation layer
```

The eventual goal (Stage B) is for LogicN to compile itself, replacing the
TypeScript layer with a LogicN-written compiler targeting CPU binary, WASM
and hardware accelerator backends directly.

## Language Overview

LogicN source files use the `.lln` extension. The language is strict by default:
no `null`, no silent coercion, no hidden exceptions, no unchecked mutation, no
raw pointers in normal code.

### File extension

```text
hello.lln
order-service.lln
payment-webhook.lln
boot.lln          ← project entry point
```

### Quick taste

```logicn
// Every flow declares what it returns — Result means it can fail
secure flow main() -> Result<Void, Error> {
  print("hello from LogicN")
  return Ok()
}
```

Run it:

```bash
node compiler/logicn.js run examples/hello.lln
```

## Annotated Code Examples

The examples below cover the v1 syntax subset runnable today. For full
governance model examples — `intent`, `governance` blocks, value-state
annotations (`unsafe unvalidated`, `safe validated`), runtime target planning
and audit proof records — see the
Knowledge Base:
[`docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-code-examples-full-flow.md`](../../docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-code-examples-full-flow.md)

### 1 — Types, records and errors

```logicn
// Type aliases give meaning to raw types.
// There is no "string ID" ambiguity — OrderId and CustomerId are distinct.
type OrderId    = String
type CustomerId = String

// Records are explicit. Every field is typed. No optional fields without
// Option<T>. No silent null.
type Order {
  id:         OrderId
  customerId: CustomerId
  total:      Float
}

// Errors are typed enums — not strings, not exceptions.
// The caller must handle every variant.
enum OrderError {
  NotFound
  InsufficientFunds
  DatabaseFailed
}
```

---

### 2 — Result and Option

```logicn
// Result<T, E> is the only error model. There are no exceptions.
// The compiler will reject code that ignores a Result.
flow loadOrder(id: OrderId) -> Result<Order, OrderError> {
  return Err(OrderError.NotFound)
}

// Option<T> is the only nullable model. There is no null.
// None must be handled — it cannot be silently propagated.
flow findEmail(customerId: CustomerId) -> Option<String> {
  return None
}

// Both must be exhaustively matched.
secure flow requireOrder(id: OrderId) -> Result<Order, OrderError> {
  let result: Result<Order, OrderError> = loadOrder(id)

  match result {
    Ok(order) => return Ok(order)
    Err(err)  => return Err(err)
  }
}
```

---

### 3 — Effects and flow safety levels

LogicN flows declare their **safety level** and their **effects**. The compiler
enforces that declared effects match actual behavior.

```logicn
// ── pure flow ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Pure flows cannot:
//   - perform I/O of any kind
//   - call effectful flows
//   - use `mut` bindings (LLN-BINDING-004)
//   - use `await`
//
// They are deterministic and composable. Use them for all computation that
// does not touch the outside world.
//
pure flow calculateDiscount(total: Float, pct: Float) -> Float {
  return total * (pct / 100.0)
}


// ── guarded flow ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Guarded flows declare the effects they use.
// The compiler verifies that every effect used inside is listed here.
// Callers must also declare these effects to use this flow.
//
guarded flow processOrder(input: CreateOrderRequest) -> Result<OrderId, OrderError>
effects [database.write, network.outbound] {

  // `let` binding — immutable. Cannot be reassigned (LLN-BINDING-001).
  let order: Order = Order {
    id:         generateId()
    customerId: input.customerId
    total:      input.total
  }

  // Result must be handled. Ignoring it is a compile error.
  match saveOrder(order) {
    Ok(saved) => return Ok(saved.id)
    Err(_)    => return Err(OrderError.DatabaseFailed)
  }
}


// ── secure flow ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Secure flows enforce additional safety rules:
//   - `Tri` cannot be used as a branch condition directly
//   - `unknown_as: true` is always an error
//   - stricter secret handling
//
secure flow verifyPayment(status: PaymentStatus) -> Decision {
  match status {
    Paid     => Allow
    Unpaid   => Review
    Pending  => Review
    Failed   => Deny
    Unknown  => Review   // explicit — not a silent fallback
  }
}
```

---

### 4 — Bindings: let, mut and readonly

LogicN has three binding forms, each with a different mutability contract that
the compiler enforces.

```logicn
// ── let — immutable binding ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `let` declares a binding that cannot be reassigned.
// Attempting to reassign it is LLN-BINDING-001.
//
let maxRetries: Int    = 3
let apiUrl:     String = "https://api.example.com"


// ── mut — explicit mutable binding ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// `mut` makes reassignment intentional and visible at the declaration site.
// `mut` is banned inside `pure flow` (LLN-BINDING-004).
// Use `mut` only when the value genuinely changes over time.
//
guarded flow retryRequest(url: String) -> Result<Response, ApiError>
effects [network.outbound] {
  mut attempts: Int = 0

  // attempts can be reassigned here
  // attempts = attempts + 1
  return http.get(url)
}


// ── readonly — read-only view ─────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `readonly` gives a read-only view of a value owned elsewhere.
// The binding cannot be reassigned, and properties cannot be mutated
// through it (LLN-BINDING-003).
// Use `readonly` for configuration, shared context and borrow parameters.
//
flow processRequest(req: Request) -> Result<Response, ApiError> {
  readonly config: AppConfig = loadConfig()

  // config.timeout = 10    ← REJECTED: LLN-BINDING-003
  // config = otherConfig   ← REJECTED: LLN-BINDING-002

  return handleWithConfig(req, config)
}
```

---

### 5 — Intent declarations

Intent makes a flow's purpose machine-readable. The effect checker, audit
system and AI tooling all consume intent declarations. A flow whose inferred
behavior conflicts with its declared intent is rejected (`LLN-INTENT-001`).

```logicn
// ── intent on a guarded flow ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// `intent` is a machine-readable declaration of what this flow is for.
// The `///` doc comments are consumed by the AI context generator.
// The `intent` keyword on the flow body is consumed by the checker.
//
/// intent: "Create a new customer order and initiate payment"
/// trust:  "input pre-validated at the API boundary by the route contract"
/// effects: [database.write, payment.charge, network.outbound]
guarded flow createOrder(input: CreateOrderRequest) -> Result<OrderId, OrderError>
effects [database.write, payment.charge, network.outbound]
intent "Create a new customer order and initiate payment" {

  let order: Order = Order {
    id:         generateId()
    customerId: input.customerId
    total:      input.total
  }

  match saveOrder(order) {
    Ok(saved) => return Ok(saved.id)
    Err(_)    => return Err(OrderError.DatabaseFailed)
  }
}


// ── intent on a secure flow ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Intent is especially important on security-critical flows.
// If the checker infers an effect not listed in intent/effects, it rejects.
//
/// intent: "Validate webhook signature and route to handler"
/// trust:  "HMAC verified before handler is called"
secure flow handlePaymentWebhook(req: Request) -> Result<Response, WebhookError>
effects [network.inbound, database.write]
intent "Validate webhook signature and route to handler" {

  unsafe let rawBody: Bytes = req.rawBody  // untrusted until decoded

  let event: PaymentEvent = json.decode<PaymentEvent>(rawBody)?

  match event.type {
    "payment.succeeded" => handlePaymentSucceeded(event)
    "payment.failed"    => handlePaymentFailed(event)
    _                   => return JsonResponse({ "ignored": true })
  }

  return JsonResponse({ "received": true })
}
```

---

### 6 — Unsafe variables: boundary data

Data crossing into the system from the outside world — HTTP request bodies,
webhook payloads, API responses, file reads — arrives as raw, unvalidated
bytes. LogicN marks these bindings with a **safety prefix** at the point they
enter the program.

The syntax puts the safety qualifier **before** the binding keyword:

```
unsafe let name: Type = boundaryValue     // declared unsafe at entry
safe   mut name = validate(name)?         // upgraded to safe in-place
```

`unsafe let` marks that the data is boundary-origin. The compiler prevents
`unsafe` values from reaching governed sinks (databases, external APIs,
audit logs) until they pass through an explicit validate or decode step.
`safe mut` upgrades the binding once validation has passed.

```logicn
// ── Incoming HTTP request — body is unsafe until decoded ──────────────────
//
// req.rawBody is untrusted bytes from a client.
// `unsafe let` marks it as boundary-origin at the point of binding.
//
secure flow createOrderFromRequest(req: Request) -> Result<Response, ApiError>
effects [network.inbound, database.write]
intent "Accept and process a new order from an HTTP request" {

  // Boundary data: unsafe at entry point
  unsafe let rawBody: Bytes = req.rawBody

  // Upgrade: decode + validate in one step
  // Err returned if schema doesn't match — no unsafe value escapes
  safe mut rawBody = json.decode<CreateOrderRequest>(rawBody)?

  match createOrder(rawBody) {
    Ok(orderId) => return JsonResponse({ "id": orderId, "status": "created" })
    Err(err)    => return ApiError.response(err)
  }
}


// ── Outgoing API call — response is unsafe until decoded ──────────────────
//
// Even responses from services you control arrive as untyped bytes.
// `unsafe let` makes the boundary visible and forces explicit decode.
//
guarded flow fetchRiskScore(customerId: CustomerId) -> Result<RiskScore, ApiError>
effects [network.outbound]
intent "Fetch customer risk score from the risk evaluation service" {

  // Response from an external service — untrusted, untyped bytes
  unsafe let rawResponse: Bytes = http.get("https://risk.internal/score/" + customerId)

  // Decode to typed value — returns Err if shape doesn't match
  safe mut rawResponse = json.decode<RiskScore>(rawResponse)?

  return Ok(rawResponse)
}


// ── File read — content is unsafe until parsed ────────────────────────────
//
guarded flow loadConfig(path: String) -> Result<AppConfig, ConfigError>
effects [filesystem.read]
intent "Load application configuration from disk" {

  unsafe let rawFile: String = fs.readText(path)

  safe mut rawFile = toml.decode<AppConfig>(rawFile)?

  return Ok(rawFile)
}
```

**Safety prefix vocabulary (v1):**

| Prefix | Applies to | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `unsafe let` | New bindings | Binding is boundary-origin; compiler blocks it from governed sinks |
| `safe mut` | Existing bindings | Upgrades an `unsafe` binding to safe after a validation/decode step |
| `unsafe mut` | Mutable bindings | Mutable boundary data (e.g. a buffer being filled) |
| (none) | Internal values | Internally constructed values — treated as safe by default |

The full grammar and state transition rules are in
[`docs/Knowledge-Bases/value-state-annotations.md`](../../docs/Knowledge-Bases/value-state-annotations.md).

### 7 — Memory: borrow and move

LogicN has a hybrid ownership model. Every value has an explicit ownership state.

```logicn
// ── borrow — temporary read-only access ──────────────────────────────────
//
// `borrow buf` passes read-only access without transferring ownership.
// The caller keeps the buffer. The borrow expires when peekFirstByte returns.
// Multiple simultaneous read-only borrows are allowed.
//
pure flow peekFirstByte(borrow buf: Buffer) -> Option<UInt8> {
  if buf.size == 0 {
    return None
  }
  return buf.data.get(0)    // returns Option<UInt8> — bounds-safe
}

// Caller: buf is still owned and usable after the call
flow inspectBuffer() -> Result<UInt8, String> {
  let buf: Buffer = Buffer { data: [0x48, 0x65, 0x6C], size: 3 }

  let first = peekFirstByte(borrow buf)  // borrow ends here

  // buf is fully owned here — borrow has expired
  match first {
    Some(b) => return Ok(b)
    None    => return Err("empty buffer")
  }
}


// ── move — explicit ownership transfer ───────────────────────────────────
//
// `move conn` transfers ownership into closeConnection.
// The caller's `conn` is invalid after this call.
// Using it afterward is LLN-MEMORY-001 (USE_AFTER_MOVE).
//
secure flow closeConnection(move conn: Connection) -> Result<Void, ConnError> {
  return conn.close()
  // conn is owned here — caller cannot use it again
}

// REJECTED: use after move
flow badExample() -> Result<Void, String> {
  let conn: Connection = Connection.open("db://...")
  closeConnection(move conn)
  return conn.ping()    // ERROR: LLN-MEMORY-001 — conn was moved
}


// ── mut binding — explicit, visible mutation ──────────────────────────────
//
// `mut` makes reassignment visible. It cannot appear in `pure flow`.
// Attempting it in a pure flow emits LLN-BINDING-004.
//
guarded flow buildList(items: Array<String>) -> Array<String>
effects [none] {
  mut result: Array<String> = []

  // processing loop (for syntax pending Phase 1 grammar)
  return result
}
```

---

### 8 — Unsafe — always explicit, always justified

Raw pointer access and other unsafe operations are allowed, but they must be
**declared, justified and recoverable**.

```logicn
// ── unsafe block ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every unsafe block must declare:
//   reason   — a human-readable justification (required)
//   fallback — a safe flow to call if the unsafe path fails (required)
//
// Missing `reason` emits LLN-MEMORY-008 (UNSAFE_MEMORY_REQUIRES_FALLBACK).
// Raw pointer access outside unsafe emits LLN-RAWPTR-001.
//
flow readRegister(addr: UInt32) -> Result<UInt32, HardwareError> {
  unsafe block readMMIO reason "MMIO register requires direct memory read" fallback safeDefault {
    let value: UInt32 = *mmio_ptr(addr)
    return Ok(value)
  }
}

// REJECTED: unsafe block without reason
flow badUnsafe() -> Result<UInt32, HardwareError> {
  unsafe block readMMIO {           // ERROR: LLN-MEMORY-008 — missing reason
    let value = *mmio_ptr(0x4000)
    return Ok(value)
  }
}

// REJECTED: raw pointer outside unsafe
flow alsoRejected(ptr: Pointer<UInt32>) -> UInt32 {
  return *ptr    // ERROR: LLN-RAWPTR-001 — raw pointer outside unsafe block
}
```

---

### 9 — Webhooks and API contracts

```logicn
// Webhook declarations include security policy — HMAC, replay protection,
// body size limits. The compiler checks the handler type.
webhook PaymentWebhook {
  path   "/webhooks/payment"
  method POST

  security {
    hmac_header      "Payment-Signature"
    secret           env.secret("PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET")
    max_age          5m
    max_body_size    512kb
    replay_protection true
  }

  idempotency_key json.path("$.id")
  handler         handlePaymentWebhook
}

// The handler is a normal typed secure flow.
// JSON decode is explicit — the schema is enforced at compile time.
secure flow handlePaymentWebhook(req: Request) -> Result<Response, WebhookError>
effects [network.inbound] {
  let event: PaymentEvent = json.decode<PaymentEvent>(req.body)

  match event.type {
    "payment.succeeded" => handlePaymentSucceeded(event)
    "payment.failed"    => handlePaymentFailed(event)
    _                   => return JsonResponse({ "ignored": true })
  }

  return JsonResponse({ "received": true })
}
```

---

### 10 — Task automation

Tasks declare their dependencies and permissions before anything runs.

```logicn
task buildApi {
  depends [generateTypes]
  effects [filesystem, compiler, reports]

  permissions {
    read  "./src"
    write "./build"
  }
}
```

Run:

```bash
node ../../logicn-core-cli/dist/index.js task buildApi --file tasks.lln --dry-run
```

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Stage A — TypeScript / Node.js Runtime                  ⬜ post-foundation
  Phase 6 delivers the first real execution layer.
  LogicN source is compiled to governed TypeScript output.
  Programs run on the Node.js runtime backed by V8.

  The full execution stack at this stage:

  LogicN Syntax
       ↓  governed checks: types, effects, memory, intent
  TypeScript runtime / compiler layer
       ↓  managed language safety, type erasure
  JavaScript output
       ↓  managed runtime semantics
  Node.js runtime
       ↓  host APIs, native bridges, event loop
  V8 JavaScript engine
       ↓  memory-managed JS execution
  C++ native internals

  This creates a layered memory-safety model — each layer contributes
  its own guarantees before reaching the hardware:

  LogicN Syntax      → intended safety model (ownership, effects, intent)
  TypeScript         → managed language safety (types, null checks)
  JavaScript         → managed runtime semantics (GC, bounds)
  Node.js            → host runtime, APIs, native bridges
  V8                 → memory-managed JS engine
  C++                → native implementation layer

  The LogicN layer provides the strongest, most explicit guarantees.
  The layers beneath it inherit managed safety from the JS ecosystem.
  This means the TypeScript runtime is a credible first execution target —
  not a compromise, but a deliberate foundation.

Stage B — LogicN Compiles Itself                        ⬜ long-term
  The LogicN compiler and runtime are rewritten in LogicN.
  The TypeScript bootstrap layer is no longer needed for production.
  LogicN becomes self-hosting: the language proves its own model.

  The execution stack at this stage:

  LogicN Syntax
       ↓  governed checks: types, effects, memory, intent
  LogicN compiler (written in LogicN)
       ↓  real code generation: CPU binary, WASM, target IR
  CPU / WASM / NPU / APU / GPU target
       ↓  hardware execution
  Physical compute

  Self-hosting is the maturity gate: if LogicN can compile LogicN
  safely — enforcing its own memory model, effects and intent
  declarations — then the governance model is real, not theoretical.
```

**After the foundation (post-v1 maturity order):**

```text
1. Real compiler pipeline: parser, AST, symbol table, type/effect/memory
   checker, IR, output
2. Traits, protocols and generic constraints
3. Deterministic cleanup for resources and secrets
4. Testing syntax and `LogicN test` model
5. FFI and trusted module system
6. Package manager and registry design
7. Async streams, cancellation, timeouts, bounded queues
8. Source-mapped runtime errors across all targets
9. Small standard library
10. Debug/profile/lint tooling
```

**Deferred until after the foundation:**

```text
finance packages        GPU target
electrical packages     AI accelerator target
OT packages             photonic target
production benchmarks   ORM / CMS / admin UI
```

## Architecture

```
logicn-core          ← you are here
  Language rules, type system, effects model, memory ownership model,
  AstNodeKind vocabulary, diagnostic contract types, examples.

logicn-core-compiler
  Scanner-level enforcement (Phase 3 live).
  Lexer, parser, AST, type/effect/memory checker (Phases 4–5).
  Diagnostic constants: LLN-MEMORY-*, LLN-SAFETY-*, LLN-BINDING-*,
    LLN-RAWPTR-*, LLN-SYNTAX-*, LLN-BLOCK-*, LLN-STRING-*, etc.

logicn-core-runtime
  Checked and compiled execution, effect dispatch, structured await,
  runtime errors, cancellation, timeout enforcement.

logicn-core-security
  SecureString, redaction, permissions, crypto policy, security reports.

logicn-core-config
  Project configuration, environment modes, production policy.

logicn-core-reports
  Shared report schemas, diagnostics, processing reports, writer contracts.

logicn-core-logic
  Tri, Decision, RiskLevel, Omni-logic, truth tables.

logicn-core-vector / logicn-core-compute
  Vectors, matrices, tensors, compute planning, target selection.

logicn-target-cpu / logicn-target-wasm   ← v1 active targets
  CPU capability detection, fallback, WASM planning.

logicn-target-gpu / logicn-ai / logicn-*  ← post-v1
  GPU, AI accelerators, neural, neuromorphic, low-bit, photonic.
```

**Hardware targets (by readiness):**

```
CPU    (v1 active)     — x86-64, ARM, RISC-V
WASM   (v1 planning)   — browser, edge, serverless
GPU    (post-v1)       — NVIDIA CUDA, AMD ROCm, Intel Arc
NPU    (post-v1)       — Intel NPU, Qualcomm Hexagon, Apple Neural Engine
APU    (post-v1)       — AMD/Intel integrated GPU+AI silicon
TPU / AI Accelerator (post-v1) — Google TPU, Intel Gaudi, AWS Trainium
Photonic (post-v1)    — optical interconnect and compute planning
```

Hardware targets are backend profiles selected by project config — not core syntax. The language itself is target-agnostic.

### Current execution stack (Stage A — TypeScript runtime)

While the real compiler is being built, LogicN programs run via Node.js:

```
LogicN Syntax
     ↓  governed checks: types, effects, memory, intent
TypeScript runtime / compiler layer
     ↓  managed language safety
JavaScript output
     ↓  managed runtime semantics
Node.js runtime
     ↓  host APIs, native bridges
V8 JavaScript engine
     ↓  memory-managed execution
C++ native internals
```

Each layer contributes its own safety guarantees. LogicN's layer is the most explicit — ownership, effects, intent. The layers below provide managed memory and runtime safety inherited from the JS ecosystem.

**Key boundaries:**

- `logicn-core` is the language. It must not become a web framework.
- `logicn-core-compiler` is the only package that owns diagnostic emission.
- Effects are declared in source — the compiler does not infer them silently.
- `unsafe` requires `reason` + `fallback` — always.
- GPU, NPU, APU, photonic, AI accelerators are backend profiles — not core syntax.

### Broader Governance Architecture

The four-stage execution pipeline is the runtime spine. The full governance architecture covers the entire software lifecycle — source through deployment through compliance. Each stage builds on the last:

```text
intent                       declared purpose, authority, denied boundaries
    ↓
authority tracking           maps where authority enters and flows
    ↓
capability propagation       tracks transitive authority through call chains
    ↓
effect propagation           traces effects across flows, packages, boundaries
    ↓
intent verification          compares declared intent vs actual behavior
    ↓
governance diffing           semantic change report between builds
    ↓
AI system comprehension      queryable semantic model for AI tools
    ↓
compliance generation        SOC2/GDPR artefacts derived from source
    ↓
runtime governance           enforces the governed plan at execution time
    ↓
unsafe boundary visibility   tracks all native/FFI/unsafe code explicitly
    ↓
resource flow tracking       maps which components touch which data and secrets
    ↓
deployment planning          infrastructure requirements from declared semantics
    ↓
runtime target planning      governed CPU/GPU/NPU/WASM target selection
    ↓
package governance           tracks authority and effects introduced by dependencies
    ↓
build-time explainability    `logicn explain <flow>` — live queryable system model
    ↓
negative guarantees          proves what the system CANNOT do
    ↓
runtime evidence correlation connects runtime events back to intent graph nodes
    ↓
AI context compression       compact semantic graph instead of raw source
    ↓
threat modelling             attack surface + secret exposure derived from graph
    ↓
architectural visualization  live diagrams from the intent graph, not manual docs
    ↓
governed execution plan      operational contract: what execution is permitted
    ↓
coordinated compute          orchestrated execution across targets within authority
    ↓
audit proof                  verifiable evidence that governed execution occurred
```

## Build Outputs

The prototype build can generate:

```text
app.bin                ← placeholder (real codegen is Phase 6)
app.wasm               ← placeholder (WASM planning is Phase 6)
app.openapi.json       ← real output from type declarations
app.security-report.json
app.memory-report.json
app.execution-report.json
app.source-map.json
app.build-manifest.json   ← per-source and dependency hashes
app.ai-guide.md           ← AI-readable project context
app.ai-context.json
```

Compiled artefacts are not secrets. Real secrets must remain in environment
variables or secret managers — never in source or build output.

---

## AI Support

LogicN is designed to be readable by AI tools without requiring large context
windows.

```bash
# Generate a compact AI-readable summary of the examples
node compiler/logicn.js ai-context examples --out build/examples

# Explain a specific file for AI context
node compiler/logicn.js explain examples/source-map-error.lln --for-ai
```

AI reports are compact, deterministic, source-mapped and free of secrets.
