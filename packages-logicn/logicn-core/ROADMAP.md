# LogicN Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned direction for **LogicN / LogicN**.

LogicN is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and accelerator-aware programming language concept.

The roadmap is designed to move LogicN from concept documentation into a working prototype, then towards a usable language toolchain.

---

## Roadmap Summary

LogicN should be developed in beta stages before any stable release:

```text
0.1.x  Documentation and concept
0.2.x  Parser prototype
0.3.x  Type and safety checker prototype
0.4.x  JSON/API/webhook prototype
0.5.x  Target planning prototype
0.6.x  AI-friendly tooling prototype
0.7.x  Developer tooling
0.8.x  Runtime prototype
0.9.x  Larger application structure and package conventions
1.0.0-beta.x  Beta language specification candidate
1.0.0         First stable language specification, only after release criteria are met
```

The first goal is not real photonic hardware support.

The first goal is to make LogicN useful and understandable on normal systems.

The current repository version is beta. It should not be described as a stable
release while compiler, runtime, package and documentation contracts are still
being shaped.

LogicN should not claim production maturity until the missing language-core work
in `docs/language-core-maturity-roadmap.md` is implemented: real compiler
pipeline, protocols/interfaces, deterministic cleanup, trusted interop, package
management, testing, async runtime semantics, source-mapped runtime errors and a
small standard library.

---

## Roadmap Principles

Every roadmap item should support one or more of these goals:

```text
make LogicN safer
make LogicN stricter
make LogicN easier to debug
make LogicN better for JSON/API systems
make LogicN better for webhooks
make LogicN better for AI coding assistants
make LogicN easier to deploy
make LogicN ready for multi-target compilation
make LogicN useful without future hardware
```

Generated roadmap documents are advisory. If a generated document conflicts
with this repository's package structure, `AGENTS.md`, workspace map or
maintained docs, the repository structure takes precedence. Version labels may
move when that produces a clearer beta, staging or release path.

## Version 1.0.0-beta.x - Beta Specification Candidate

### Goal

Publish a beta LogicN language specification candidate and basic toolchain for
review before any stable release.

### Required for 1.0.0-beta.x

```text
beta .lln syntax
beta boot.lln structure
beta strict type rules
beta Option and Result model
beta Decision model
beta JSON model
beta API/webhook model
beta source-map format
beta compiler report formats
working parser
working checker
working formatter
working linter
working examples
clear documentation
Apache-2.0 licence
```

### Not Required for 1.0.0-beta.x

```text
real photonic hardware backend
full production GPU backend
complete package manager
formal verification
built-in full MVC framework
large standard library
```

The beta candidate should focus on correctness, clarity and developer
experience. A later stable `1.0.0` release should happen only after beta review,
compatibility checks, security review and documentation sign-off.

---

## Long-Term Roadmap

Long-term ideas include:

```text
LLVM backend
MLIR backend
WASM backend
native executable compiler
real GPU backend
ONNX support
AI model pipeline support
photonic vendor backend
ternary-native backend
package manager
language server
VS Code extension
web playground
debugger
deployment tooling
formal verification tools
standard library
web framework packages
cloud deployment adapters
```

## Post-Beta Major Roadmap

The following major-version direction is advisory and may move as the beta
stabilises:

```text
v10  Advanced Hardware
v11  Financial Industry and Stock Market Support
v13  OSWARP - Operating System Wrapper and Runtime Portability
v18  Syntax and Security Review
v19  Framework Review
v20  Standards and ISO Review
v21  Basic Mobile Graphics
```

`v10` should cover advanced hardware planning before mobile and finance
expansion. GPU, AI accelerator, low-bit AI, optical I/O, photonic, ternary and
Omni-logic work remain planning, simulation and report layers unless concrete
backend support exists.

`v11` may cover financial-market data, money and currency types, risk, audit,
trading safety boundaries and stock-market support. These should be package or
standard-library candidates, not unreviewed core syntax.

The first `v11` planning surface should be the grouped `logicn-finance-core` package
area. Start with deterministic finance maths, calendars, market data, FIX
contracts and audit/replay evidence before risk, pricing, desktop interop or
low-latency runtime profiles.

`v13` may use OSWARP as a working name for Operating System Wrapper and Runtime
Portability. It should wrap runtime portability and platform policy rather than
turning LogicN into an operating system.

`v20` should align relevant LogicN contracts with ISO, IEC, IEEE, W3C, OWASP and
NIST-style standards where useful. `v21` should keep mobile graphics basic:
canvas-style primitives, charting and adapter planning such as Flutter or Skia,
without making frontend frameworks part of `logicn-core`.

`docs/language-positioning-principles.md` should guide positioning. LogicN
should compete through explicit security contracts, effect/permission reports,
AI-readable project context, target-aware planning and source-mapped diagnostics.

---

## Future Hardware Roadmap

LogicN should support future hardware carefully.

### Stage 1

```text
target planning
simulation
reports
fallback design
```

### Stage 2

```text
GPU backend
WASM backend
MLIR/LLVM integration
ONNX integration
```

### Stage 3

```text
photonic backend when hardware/tooling is available
ternary-native backend if hardware becomes practical
vendor-specific accelerator adapters
```

Photonic support should never block normal LogicN usage.

---

## Documentation Roadmap

Documentation should expand into:

```text
docs/syntax.md
docs/type-system.md

strict types
no undefined
no silent null
Result and Option checks
SecureString
secret logging prevention
JSON safety policy
webhook HMAC verification
idempotency
replay protection
permissions
effect system
package permission checks
security reports

```

---

## API and JSON Roadmap

API and JSON should be core to LogicN adoption.

Priority order:

```text
typed JSON decoding
raw JSON access
JSON policy
JSON schema generation
API route contracts
webhook contracts
OpenAPI output
request validation
response validation
API reports
API client generation
test mocks
```

---

## AI Tooling Roadmap

AI tooling should be part of LogicN from early stages.

Priority order:

```text
machine-readable errors
source-map aware diagnostics
app.ai-context.json
app.ai-context.md
LogicN explain --for-ai
redaction rules
changed-file summaries
route/type summaries
target summaries
suggested next actions
```

---

## Deployment Roadmap

Deployment should support build-once, deploy-many.

Priority order:

```text
build manifest
source hashes
output hashes
dependency hashes
.env outside compiled files
server environment variables
artefact verification
health checks
rollback guidance
compiled app Git guidance
CI/CD examples
```

---

## Git Roadmap

Git documentation should include two documents.

```text
GIT.md
```

For the LogicN language repository.

```text
COMPILED_APP_GIT.md
```

For applications built with LogicN.

These documents should explain:

```text
branching
commits
tags
releases
generated files
build outputs
source maps
.env files
compiled artefacts
deployment records
```

---

## Success Criteria

LogicN is successful if it becomes:

```text
easy to understand
safe by default
strict by default
good for JSON/API work
good for webhook systems
easy to debug after compilation
friendly to AI coding assistants
useful on normal CPUs
ready for future accelerator targets
```

---

## Risks

Known risks:

```text
scope becomes too broad
language becomes too complex
photonic focus distracts from practical use
syntax becomes too unfamiliar
compiler implementation becomes too difficult
package ecosystem never grows
AI tooling becomes an afterthought
JSON/API support becomes too framework-like
security claims become too strong
```

---

## Risk Controls

Controls:

```text
prioritise CPU usefulness first
prioritise JSON/API use cases early
keep syntax small
document non-goals
avoid unsupported claims
build reports before real exotic backends
keep kernel and driver development last and permission-gated
make examples practical
keep source maps central
keep security defaults strict
```

---

## Kernel and Driver Development Policy

Kernel and driver development is not an early roadmap item.

It should happen only after the language specification, memory model, security
model, native binding policy, runtime isolation strategy and target reports are
stable.

Rule:

```text
kernel and driver development is last-stage work
kernel and driver development requires explicit maintainer or project permission
no kernel module, driver, privileged runtime, vendor SDK binding or raw hardware
backend should start without approval
```

---

## Final Roadmap Statement

LogicN should move from:

```text
concept → documentation → parser → safety checker → JSON/API prototype → target planner → AI tooling → runtime → stable specification
```

The roadmap should keep LogicN practical today and ready for future compute tomorrow.
