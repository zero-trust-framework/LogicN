# LogicN Non-Supported Native Features

## Summary

LogicN is a strict, memory-safe, security-first general-purpose programming language.

This document defines what LogicN should **not** support as native language features.

The purpose of this document is to prevent LogicN from becoming too large, unclear, unstable, or framework-like.

LogicN should provide safe primitives.

Specialist systems should be built using packages, drivers, frameworks, tooling, or external services.

---

## Guiding Rule

The main rule is:

> If a feature normally belongs in a package, library, framework, driver,
> extension, or external service, LogicN should not make that thing a native
> language feature.

LogicN may provide the safe building blocks.

LogicN should not provide the full specialist system.

---

## Core Non-Support Principle

LogicN should not natively become:

```text
a framework
a database
a CMS
a search engine
a translation engine
an AI platform
a media editor
an email platform
an authentication platform
a queue platform
a cloud provider
a browser framework
a mobile framework
an operating system
a media framework
a camera API
a device API layer
an API gateway
a load balancer
an LLM runtime
an NLP framework
a document AI platform
a text generation engine
a business rules engine
```

LogicN should instead provide:

```text
strict types
memory safety
effects
permissions
safe files
streams
binary data
network boundaries
crypto primitives
secret handling
logging primitives
testing support
runtime profiles
compiler reports
package security
interop boundaries
multi-target compilation
```

Device and phone capabilities belong behind packages, platform bindings,
operating-system APIs, drivers or frameworks. LogicN core should provide safe
types, permissions, effects, streams, buffers, compute targets, capability
detection, FFI boundaries and reports.

See `docs/device-capability-boundaries.md`.

Text AI capabilities such as summarisation, generation, embeddings, moderation,
translation, document question answering, named entity extraction and sentiment
analysis belong in packages, model providers, frameworks or external services.
LogicN core should provide typed boundaries, text validation, token policies,
redaction rules, prompt-safety hooks, effects, permissions, `compute auto` and
reports.

See `docs/text-ai-package-boundaries-and-compute-auto.md`.

Authentication products and identity platforms belong in packages, frameworks
or external identity providers. LogicN core should provide secure strings, token
validation boundaries, proven crypto primitives, route auth declarations,
proof-of-possession checks, replay protection and security reports.

See `docs/auth-token-verification-boundaries.md`.

game editor tools
```

LogicN may provide:

```text
strict types
memory safety
binary data
streams
interop
GPU target declarations
runtime profiles
performance reports
```

Correct wording:

```text
Game engines can use LogicN primitives, but they are not native language features.
```

Avoid wording:

```text
LogicN includes a built-in game engine.
```

# 34. Data Science Platforms

## Native Support Status

```text
Native language feature: No
Supported through primitives: Yes
Belongs in: Packages, external tools, specialist runtimes
```

LogicN should not natively support:

```text
notebook platforms
dataframe engines
charting systems
machine learning platforms
statistics platforms
data cleaning frameworks
data warehouse engines
BI dashboards
```

LogicN may provide:

```text
Decimal
typed arrays
streams
file access
database driver boundaries
GPU target declarations
structured reports
interop
```

Correct wording:

```text
Data science tools belong in packages or external platforms.
```

Avoid wording:

```text
LogicN natively supports data science notebooks.
```

# 35. Native Support Decision Test

Before adding any feature to LogicN itself, ask:

```text
Is this needed by most programs?
Does this affect safety, typing, memory, effects, permissions, errors, or compilation?
Would this normally need a package, extension, framework, driver, or external service?
Can this be implemented cleanly as a package?
Would adding this make LogicN harder to keep stable?
Would this create provider lock-in?
Would this make LogicN look like a framework rather than a language?
```

If the feature is specialist, provider-specific, domain-specific, or application-specific, it should not be a native language feature.

# 36. Approved Replacement Wording

Use this wording when refactoring existing documents.

Instead of:

```text
LogicN supports PDF.
```

Use:

```text
LogicN supports file streams and binary data that PDF packages can use.
```

Instead of:

```text
LogicN supports email.
```

Use:

```text
LogicN supports networking, safe secrets and typed payloads that email packages can use.
```

Instead of:

```text
LogicN supports SQL.
```

Use:

```text
LogicN supports typed database driver boundaries. SQL drivers belong in packages.
```

Instead of:

```text
LogicN supports search.
```

Use:

```text
LogicN supports typed provider boundaries that search packages can use.
```

Instead of:

```text
LogicN supports AI.
```

Use:

```text
LogicN supports safe compute, networking and streaming primitives that AI packages can use.
```

Instead of:

```text
LogicN supports video.
```

Use:

```text
LogicN supports binary streams and backpressure primitives that video packages can use.
```

# 37. Final Non-Support List

LogicN should not natively support:

```text
search engines
translation engines
image editors
audio processors
video editors
PDF engines
DOCX engines
XLSX engines
email platforms
SMS platforms
authentication frameworks
SQL database engines
NoSQL database engines
vector databases
ORM frameworks
queue brokers
browser frameworks
DOM frameworks
CSS frameworks
UI frameworks
CMS platforms
AI platforms
cloud platforms
serverless provider platforms
payment platforms
analytics platforms
storage providers
deployment platforms
business rule engines
legal expert systems
medical expert systems
financial advice systems
game engines
data science platforms
provider-specific SDKs
hard-coded human language lists
hardware vendor-specific language features
```

---

# 38. Final Position

LogicN should stay focused.

LogicN is:

```text
a strict language
a memory-safe language
a security-first language
a typed language
a systems-aware language
a multi-target language
a package-aware language
an AI-readable language
a safe foundation for building software
```

LogicN is not:

```text
a framework
a database
a CMS
a search engine
a translation engine
an AI platform
a media editor
an email platform
an authentication platform
a cloud provider
a queue platform
a browser framework
a business rules engine
```

The correct model is:

```text
LogicN core:
  safe language primitives

LogicN standard library:
  common low-level utilities

LogicN packages:
  specialist capabilities

LogicN frameworks:
  application structure

LogicN tools:
  reports, builds, tests and deployment helpers

External services:
  databases, search engines, AI providers, email providers, payment providers and cloud platforms
```

LogicN should be powerful because its foundations are safe, strict and clear.

It should not become powerful by adding every possible framework, provider, or application feature into the language.
