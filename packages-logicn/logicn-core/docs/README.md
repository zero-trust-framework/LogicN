# LogicN Documentation

This directory contains detailed LogicN language, compiler, runtime and target design documents.

Root files such as `README.md`, `SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `OMNI_LOGIC.md` should act as entry points. Detailed subject documents should live here.

For the runnable v0.1 prototype, start with the repository-root
`GETTING_STARTED.md`, `compiler/README.md` and `examples/README.md`.

## Coverage Update Status

`../../../docs/COVERAGE.md` is the active coverage tracker for package docs and
Knowledge Base files. When coverage notes conflict with this directory, prefer
the owning package README/TODO and the newest canonical KB before changing
language-core docs.

Current canonical notes:

- `logicn-core-logic` owns the v0.2 `TriState`, `Decision`,
  `BoolBoundaryResult` and Omni contracts.
- `logicn-core-network` owns webhook HMAC, replay and idempotency contracts.
- `logicn-core-security` owns protected secret references and safe sink policy.
- `logicn-core-photonic` owns photonic runtime target semantics; photonic/vector
  ownership and diagnostic-code conflicts are unresolved.
- `logicn-core` docs may reference these packages, but should not make package
  implementation details look like language-core syntax.

## Package Boundary References

`logicn-core` documentation may describe syntax, compiler checks and report
contracts for package-owned concepts, but the package-specific docs should be
updated first:

```text
../../logicn-core-logic/README.md
../../logicn-core-compiler/README.md
../../logicn-core-runtime/README.md
../../logicn-core-security/README.md
../../logicn-core-config/README.md
../../logicn-core-reports/README.md
../../logicn-core-vector/README.md
../../logicn-core-compute/README.md
../../logicn-ai/README.md
../../logicn-ai-lowbit/README.md
../../logicn-core-photonic/README.md
../../logicn-target-cpu/README.md
../../logicn-cpu-kernels/README.md
../../logicn-target-native/README.md
../../logicn-target-wasm/README.md
../../logicn-target-gpu/README.md
../../../docs/AI_ACCELERATOR_TARGETS.md
../../../docs/OPTICAL_IO.md
../../logicn-target-photonic/README.md
../../logicn-framework-app-kernel/README.md

../../logicn-core-cli/README.md
../../logicn-core-tasks/README.md
../../logicn-tools-benchmark/README.md
../../logicn-devtools-project-graph/README.md
```

Use `package-boundaries.md` to decide whether a change belongs in `logicn-core` or
one of the sibling packages.

## Per-Syntax Reference

The `docs/sytax/` folder contains one-file-per-feature syntax notes.

When adding or changing LogicN syntax, update both the relevant design document and
the matching file under `docs/sytax/`.

The `docs/sytax-examples/` folder contains matching good/bad usage examples for
each syntax feature. Update it at the same time as `docs/sytax/`.

## Generated Build Documentation

The prototype writes generated documentation under the selected build output
directory, usually `build/examples/docs/` for production-style example builds
or `.build-dev/docs/` for development generation.

```text
api-guide.md
webhook-guide.md
type-reference.md
global-registry-guide.md
security-guide.md
runtime-guide.md
memory-pressure-guide.md
run-compile-mode-guide.md
deployment-guide.md
ai-summary.md
docs-manifest.json
```

These generated files describe the checked source and build reports. They are
separate from the hand-written design documents in this directory.
