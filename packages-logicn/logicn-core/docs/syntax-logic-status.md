# LogicN Syntax And Logic Status

This table gives a compact status view of common programming concepts in
LogicN. It is a planning aid, not a claim of full language maturity.

Status key:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Implemented prototype | Covered by current `.lln` examples and prototype checks. |
| Documented draft | Described in language docs, but parser/checker coverage is incomplete. |
| Package-owned | Belongs in a reusable package, not the core language. |
| TODO | Needed for v1 or production maturity, but not yet implemented. |
| Not core | Intentionally excluded from core syntax. |

Security risk key:

| Risk | Meaning | Colour hint |
|---|---|---|
| High | Common source of injection, memory unsafety, secret leakage, unsafe I/O or hidden control flow. | Red |
| Potential | Safe if designed carefully, but needs parser/checker/runtime rules before production use. | Orange |
| Managed | Security-relevant, but LogicN has an explicit safer design direction or prototype check. | Blue |
| OK | Low direct security risk; mostly syntax, documentation or compile-time structure. | Green |
| N/A | Not core syntax or not applicable to normal LogicN source. | Grey |

Plain Markdown does not reliably preserve table-cell colours across GitHub,
editors and generated docs. Use the text grade as the stable source of truth;
HTML or CSS badges may be added later by the documentation renderer.

| Concept | LogicN form or decision | Status | Security risk | Short reason |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| Recoverable error | `Result<T, E>`, `Ok`, `Err` | Implemented prototype | Managed | Errors are visible in function signatures. |
| Exceptions | not the default error model | Documented draft | Potential | Readable `try` may exist only as syntax over explicit `Result`. |
| Arrays/lists | `Array<T>` | Implemented prototype | Potential | Generic collection shape is explicit; bounds checks remain required. |
| Maps | `Map<K, V>` | Documented draft | Potential | Full parser/checker coverage is pending. |
| Sets | `Set<T>` | Documented draft | OK | Full parser/checker coverage is pending. |
| Printing simple text | `print("text")` | Implemented prototype | Potential | Production output needs redaction policy. |
| Raw object dump | no native raw dump; use future safe debug/report output | TODO / Not core | High | Dumps must respect redaction, size limits and secret-safe values. |
| Logging | planned `console.*` / reports | TODO | High | Production logging needs redaction and policy checks. |
| Secret-safe output | `view: secret` denied from normal returns/logs/AI/cache | Documented draft | Managed | Secret exposure must require a narrow safe sink and audit trail. |

| JSON encode | `json.encode` | Documented draft | Potential | Planned as typed JSON support. |
| API route | `api Name { POST "/path" { ... } }` | Implemented prototype | Managed | API boundaries are typed contracts. |
| Resource budget | `budget { cpu: small memory: small time: 100ms }` direction | Documented draft | Managed | Budgets limit resource exhaustion and expensive abuse paths. |
| Audit declaration | `audit required event "..."` | Documented draft | Managed | Security-relevant flows should produce explicit audit evidence. |
| Audit actor attribution | runtime-owned actor/request/permission context | Documented draft | Managed | Audit identity should inherit governed runtime context and not be spoofed by app code. |
| Multi-actor audit metadata | `affected_actor`, `delegated_actor`, `source_actor`, `system_actor`, `ai_actor` | Documented draft | Managed | Extra actors may be metadata, but primary actor remains runtime-owned. |
| Webhook | `webhook` syntax/docs | Implemented prototype/draft | High | Deeper verification remains package/kernel work. |
| Effects | `effects [network.inbound]` | Implemented prototype/draft | Managed | Effects are visible for security and target planning. |
| Raw SQL | gated by `allow db.raw_sql` | Documented draft | High | Typed queries are preferred; raw SQL is high-risk authority. |
| Field read rules | `fields: [id, owner]`, `fields: all except [...]`, `fields: all current except [...]` | Documented draft | Managed | Explicit allow lists are safest; broad reads need warnings and future-field controls. |

| Memory ownership | hybrid ownership/borrowing model | TODO | High | Required before production safety claims. |
| Manual pointer-like access | not core LogicN syntax | Not core | High | Unsafe memory access must go through audited interop/trusted modules. |
| Native-compatible layout | `layout native struct` at ABI/systems boundaries | Documented draft | High | Must declare alignment, ownership and report risk. |
| Systems profile | future `profile systems_safe` / `profile interop_native` | TODO | High | Low-level buffers and ABI work need memory model maturity first. |

| Packages | package registry/lock/profile docs | TODO | High | Package resolution must be reproducible and permissioned. |
| Classes/inheritance | disallowed in normal LogicN source | Not core | High | Use records, enums, flows, contracts and explicit composition instead; inherited authority is not allowed. |
| Contract polymorphism | contracts plus explicit implementations/adapters | Documented draft | Managed | Allows different implementations without hiding authority. |
| Variant polymorphism | sealed variants plus exhaustive `match` | TODO | Managed | Needed for safe domain variation without inheritance chains. |
| Generics | `Array<T>`, `Result<T,E>`, typed contracts | Documented draft | Potential | Generic constraints/protocols remain production-readiness work. |
| Protocols/interfaces | protocol/constraint model pending | TODO | Potential | Needed before mature generic libraries and contract polymorphism. |

| NPU target | `prefer npu`, explicit fallback reports | Package-owned | Potential | NPU is a compute target for model inference, not general-purpose code. |
| Unsafe regex/patterns | `Pattern`, `UnsafeRegex` policy docs | Documented draft | High | Unsafe regex must be named and gated. |
| Tests | `LogicN test`, future test syntax | Implemented prototype/draft | Managed | CLI has prototype tests; source-level test syntax remains pending. |

## Detailed Syntax Checklist

This checklist is intentionally broad. Some entries are active v1 work, some are
package-owned, and some are listed specifically so they are not accidentally
invented as core syntax later.

## Not Core For V1

These constructs are listed separately so they are visible without cluttering the
active syntax checklist. They are not part of the v1 core surface. Some may be
reconsidered later after the parser, checker, memory model, effect system and
package boundaries are stable.

| Area | Item | Security risk | Reason not in v1 core |
|---|---|---|---|
| Functions | variadic function | Potential | Weakens typed API contracts unless carefully constrained. |
| Branching | ternary expression | Potential | `match` and explicit `if` are clearer for strict logic. |
| Loops | infinite `loop` | High | Too easy to hide runaway work; require explicit `while` or worker policy. |
| Loops | `do while` | Potential | Avoid extra loop forms until core grammar is stable. |
| Loops | comprehensions | Potential | Can hide allocation, iteration cost and effects. |
| Concurrency | detached task | High | Unstructured tasks weaken cleanup, cancellation and auditability. |
| Data | class | Potential | Use records plus flows first; class syntax can wait. |
| Data | method | Potential | Prefer namespaced flows until the object model is designed. |
| Data | constructor | Potential | Prefer typed values and validation flows. |
| Data | inheritance | High | Disallowed in normal LogicN source; use contracts, adapters, variants and generics. |
| Values | global variable | High | Conflicts with strict global registry and effect visibility. |
| Values | `const` as separate v0.1 syntax | Potential | `readonly` is enough for now; compile-time constants can be reconsidered later. |
| Values | static local | High | Hidden state should be explicit and reported. |
| Operators | null coalescing | Potential | Prefer explicit `Option` matching. |
| Operators | operator overloading | Potential | Can hide work/effects; reconsider after protocols. |
| Metaprogramming | compile-time function execution | High | Too much complexity before parser/checker maturity. |
| Runtime mutation | monkey patching | High | Hidden runtime mutation is incompatible with LogicN contracts and reports. |

## Practical Rule

When a feature is ordinary control flow or type safety, it can belong in
`logicn-core`. When a feature talks to a device, framework, model, database,
network provider or native library, it should usually be package-owned and
reported instead of becoming permanent core syntax.
