# Omni-Logic Design

Ownership note: `logicn-core` may document syntax and compatibility constraints for
Omni logic, but detailed Omni logic semantics, widths, truth tables and reports
belong in `packages-logicn/logicn-core-logic/`.

Current v0.2 package contract: Omni states are documented in
`packages-logicn/logicn-core-logic/README.md` and
`docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-core-logic-omni-logic.md`. Uncertain Omni states
must map to `review()` rather than directly to runtime Bool, and Omni output is
advisory until converted through `Decision`.

LogicN should be Omni-logic compatible from the start.

Omni-logic means LogicN can describe and report logic behaviour through a general logic-width abstraction instead of hard-coding every system as ternary-only.

## Design Goals

```text
support binary CPU logic today
support ternary simulation as a first-class feature
leave room for quaternary and wider multi-state logic
report target support clearly
avoid source, schema and compiler names that block expansion
```

## Conceptual Syntax

Initial syntax may allow named modes:

```LogicN
logic mode ternary

state false
state unknown
state true
```

Future-compatible syntax should also allow explicit widths:

```LogicN
logic width 5

state false
state low
state unknown
state high
state true
```

## Compatibility Rule

The compiler should treat logic mode as a program requirement and target capability.

```text
program requested width = source requirement
target supported width  = backend capability
fallback                = compiler/runtime policy
```

If the target cannot support the requested width, LogicN must warn, error or fail according to the declared fallback policy.

## Naming Rule

Prefer:

```text
logic-state
logic-width
logic-mode
logic-target
omni-logic
multi-state
```

Avoid:

```text
ternary-only
three-way-only
photonic-only
```
