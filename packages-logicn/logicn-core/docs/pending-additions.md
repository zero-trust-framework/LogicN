# LogicN Pending Additions

This document collects LogicN ideas that should be added to the documentation or checked against the current repository.

The purpose is to avoid losing important concepts while the LogicN language and documentation structure is being refined.

---

## Summary

LogicN already has a strong concept around:

```text
strict types
memory safety
security-first design
JSON-native APIs
AI-friendly reports
source maps
compile and run modes
future GPU / photonic / ternary targets
```

The foLOwing items should be added, reviewed or confirmed in the repository.

---

## 1. Generated Outputs in Run Mode

Status: documented in `docs/run-and-compile-modes.md`; prototype support exists for `LogicN run --generate`, `LogicN generate`, `LogicN dev` and `LogicN dev --watch`.

LogicN should be able to generate useful outputs even when the project is not fully compiled.

A full production compile should still generate the complete build artefacts, but development mode should also be able to generate reports, guides and documentation from checked source.

Suggested commands:

```bash
LogicN run
LogicN run --generate
LogicN generate
LogicN dev
LogicN dev --watch
LogicN build
LogicN build --mode release
```

Command behaviour:

| Command | Runs App | Generates Docs/Reports | Produces Binary |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `LogicN run` | Yes | Optional | No |
| `LogicN run --generate` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `LogicN generate` | No | Yes | No |
| `LogicN dev` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `LogicN dev --watch` | Yes | Yes | No |
| `LogicN build` | Optional | Yes | Yes |
| `LogicN build --mode release` | No / optional | Yes | Yes |

Rule:

```text
Generated explanation should not require a production compile.
Production artefacts require a compile.
```

---

## 2. Unified Development Command

Status: prototype support exists for a checked generate-and-run cycle, including `LogicN dev --watch` for re-running that cycle when `.lln` files change.

Recommended command:

```bash
LogicN dev
```

This should:

```text
check source
generate development outputs
update AI guide
update API docs
update schemas
run the app
watch for changes if requested
```

Suggested `LogicN dev` flow:

```text
read boot.lln
parse source files
type-check source
security-check source
check strict comments
check API/webhook contracts
generate development reports
generate AI guide
generate docs
run application
watch for changes if enabled
```

---

## 2A. Startup Validation

Status: documented in `docs/startup-validation.md`; full startup report,
environment validation, route/security policy checks and package permission
checks remain pending.

Core rule:

```text
LogicN must validate the project before main() runs.
```

Startup order:

```text
1. Read boot.lln
2. Validate project config
3. Validate imports and packages
4. Validate globals, env vars and secrets
5. Validate security policy
6. Validate routes/webhooks

Status: documented in `docs/safe-pattern-matching-and-regex.md` and
`docs/sytax/patterns-and-regex.md`, with usage examples in
`docs/sytax-examples/patterns-and-regex.md`; parser support, safe engine
integration, UnsafeRegex production gates, pattern reports and denied-feature
diagnostics remain pending.

Core rule:

```text
Pattern is safe, fast and default.
UnsafeRegex is advanced, explicit and audited.
Default regex must be bounded and ReDoS-resistant.
```

Pending implementation examples:

```text

parse pattern_policy
parse unsafe regex blocks
parse pattern_set blocks
define denied feature diagnostics
define compile-inside-loop warnings
define pattern report schema

integrate or wrap a safe pattern engine
```

Documentation rule:

```text
When pattern syntax changes, update docs/sytax/patterns-and-regex.md.
When pattern examples change, update docs/sytax-examples/patterns-and-regex.md.
```

---

## 3. AI Token Reduction

Status: documented in `docs/ai-token-reduction.md`; prototype includes `LogicN ai-context`, `LogicN explain --for-ai` and token reports.

Core idea:

```text
Do not make AI read the whole project.
Make LogicN generate compact, trusted summaries from the code that actually compiled or checked successfully.
```

AI-friendly generated files:

```text
app.ai-guide.md
app.ai-context.json
app.failure-report.json
app.source-map.json
app.map-manifest.json
app.tokens.json
app.api-report.json
app.security-report.json
```

Suggested commands:

```bash
LogicN ai-context
LogicN explain --for-ai
LogicN tokens
LogicN summarize
LogicN changed
```

---

## 4. Memory and Variable Use

Status: documented in `docs/memory-and-variable-use.md`; prototype has initial `Json.clone()` and read-only `&Json` mutation diagnostics.

Core rule:

```text
LogicN should avoid hidden copies of large values.
```

Goals:

```text
no global variable dependency
no repeated 500kb copies
safe local lifetime
fast read-only sharing
explicit copies only
better memory control
```

---

## 5. Lazy Compact JSON

Status: documented in `docs/lazy-compact-json.md`; compiler/linter checks and memory report schema remain pending.

Core rule:

```text
Small JSON stays simple.
Read-only JSON is borrowed.
Dataset-style JSON can use repeated node shape optimisation.
Modified or duplicated JSON is checked before copying.
Compact only when the saving is worthwhile.
Patch instead of duplicating.
Stream when very large.
Keep compact format internal.
```

---

## 6. Pure Flow Caching

Status: documented in `docs/pure-flow-caching.md`; deeper compiler support remains pending.

Core rule:

```text
Only deterministic, side-effect-free flows can be cached automatically.
```

Cache limit rule:

```text
calculate the result
return the result
do not store it in cache
record cache bypass
recommend better settings if useful
```

---

## 7. Memory Pressure and Disk Spill

Status: documented in `docs/memory-pressure-and-disk-spill.md`; prototype emits memory and runtime reports.

Memory pressure ladder:

```text
1. Free short-lived finished values.
2. Evict eligible caches.
3. Bypass cache storage.
4. Apply backpressure to queues and channels.
5. Spill approved data to disk if configured.
6. Reject new work safely.
7. Fail gracefully before uncontrolled out-of-memory.
```

Spill rule:

```text
Only approved non-secret data may spill to disk.
```

---

## 8. Omni Logic

Status: documented in `OMNI_LOGIC.md`, `docs/omni-logic.md`, `docs/logic-widths.md` and `docs/logic-targets.md`; prototype has initial logic mode/width checks.

Core model:

```text
Bool       = two-state logic
Tri        = three-state logic
Decision   = business/security three-state logic
LogicN   = future multi-state logic
```

Rule:

```text
Do not hard-code three states into the language core.
Make three-way logic a standard logic domain.
Make multi-state logic a first-class extension point.
```

---

## 9. Strict Global Registry

Status: documented in `docs/strict-global-registry.md`; prototype parses globals and emits global reports.

Core rule:

```text
Local by default.
Global by declaration.
Mutable only by controlled state.

```

---

## 11. Generated Output And Runtime Ergonomics

Status: documented in `docs/generated-output-and-runtime-ergonomics.md`.

Best positioning:

```text
LogicN is designed for developers who want readable source, strict types,
memory-safe runtime behavior, built-in API/security reports, AI-friendly project
summaries and future accelerator planning.
```

---

## 11A. Primary Lane and Offload Nodes

Status: documented in `docs/primary-lane-and-offload-nodes.md`; compiler/runtime syntax and budget checks remain pending.

Core rule:

```text
Primary lane stays responsive.
Offload nodes handle bounded background work.
CPU and memory budgets are explicit.
Failures are reported.
Security-critical work stays on the primary lane unless explicitly and safely awaited.
```

Purpose:

```text
Main task stays on the primary CPU lane.
Repetitive/background/heavy tasks are pushed to smaller worker CPU nodes.
The compiler/runtime controls how much CPU those workers are aLOwed to use.
```

---

## 11B. Frontend Compilation Targets

Status: documented in `docs/frontend-compilation-js-wasm.md`; browser target syntax, JavaScript output and hybrid WebAssembly wrapper support remain pending.

Core model:

```text
JavaScript target for browser interaction.
WebAssembly target for heavy compute.
Hybrid target for real-world frontend apps.
```

Browser output must block server-only imports, private environment access and secrets because compiled frontend code is public.

---

## 11B.1. Browser, DOM and Web Platform Primitives

Status: documented in `docs/browser-dom-and-web-platform-primitives.md`;
SafeHtml, DOM effects, browser permission policy, fetch/storage/cookie policy,

Vector-aware for repeated safe calculations.
Pure vector blocks by default.
Side effects blocked by default.
Scalar fallback for backwards compatibility.
Compiler reports every vector decision.
```

Tagline:

```text
LogicN is scalar-first, vector-aware, and security-first.
```

Dataset syntax direction:

```text
Use `vectorize rows { ... }` where row data becomes typed vector columns.
Use `pure vector flow` when an entire flow is vector-preferred.
Use `pure vector required flow` when vectorisation must succeed.
```

---

## 11C.0. Simple Vector Syntax and Compute Auto

Status: documented in `docs/simple-vector-and-compute-auto.md`; parser support, target selection implementation and runtime hardware detection remain pending.

Core rule:

Status: documented in `docs/hybrid-logic-and-wavelength-compute.md`; compiler
support, target reports, wavelength syntax and analogue precision schemas remain
pending.

Core rule:

```text
Use exact logic where correctness matters.
Use vector/accelerator logic where performance matters.
Use three-way logic where uncertainty matters.
Use wavelength logic only for suitable pure maths.
```

Safety direction:

```text
wavelength logic cannot perform file, network or database I/O
wavelength logic cannot handle secrets
wavelength logic cannot make final security decisions directly
analogue results must return to strict typed LogicN values
precision and tolerance must be declared
fallback must be declared
```

---

```

Highest priority formal files are now present, but many still need deeper specification detail.

---

## 13. SPEC.md

Status: added; needs expansion toward an official language specification.

`SPEC.md` should define the official LogicN language rules.

It should include:

```text
keywords
file structure
comments
strict comments
types
flows
modules
imports
visibility
errors
effects
contracts
logic domains
compute blocks
API blocks
webhook blocks
run mode
compile mode
compiler reports
```

---

## 13A. Flow Keyword Rationale

Status: documented in `docs/syntax.md` and `docs/glossary.md`.

Core rule:

```text
In LogicN, a flow is the language's version of a function, but with extra meaning for security, effects, reports, rollback, AI context and target optimisation.
```

Reason:

```text
function = generic function
flow     = checked unit of behaviour that LogicN can analyse, map, report, secure, optimise and compile
```

Recommended syntax:

```LogicN
pure flow calculateVat(subtotal: Decimal) -> Decimal {
  return subtotal * 0.20
}

secure flow createOrder(req: Request) -> Result<Response, ApiError>
effects [network.inbound, database.write] {
  ...
}
```

---

## 14. Error Codes

Status: documented in `docs/error-codes.md`; prototype emits standard LogicN warning/error/fatal code format.

Example families:

```text
logicn-WARN-MEM-001
logicn-ERR-MEM-001
logicn-FATAL-MEM-001
logicn-WARN-TARGET-001
logicn-ERR-LOGIC-001
```

---

## 15. Contracts

Status: documented in `docs/contracts.md`; compiler support remains pending.

Example:

```LogicN
secure flow shipOrder(order: Order) -> Result<Shipment, ShipmentError>
requires order.payment.status == Paid
ensures result.status == Shipped
effects [database.write, network.outbound] {
  ...
}
```

---

## 16. Modules and Visibility

std.math
std.matrix
std.file
std.database
std.queue
std.testing
std.security
```

---

## 18. Repository Structure Clarification

Status: captured in `COMPATIBILITY.md`.

The Git repository itself represents the LogicN package root.

Equivalent intended path:

```text
packages-logicn/logicn-core/
```

Inside this repository, paths should be root-relative.

Correct:

```text
compiler/logicn.js
examples/hello.lln
schemas/ai-context.schema.json
docs/type-system.md
```

Incorrect inside this repository:

```text
packages-logicn/logicn-core/compiler/logicn.js
packages-logicn/logicn-core/examples/hello.lln
packages-logicn/logicn-core/schemas/ai-context.schema.json
```

---

## 19. TODO.md Updates

Status: updated for current known files. Remaining TODOs should track implementation depth, not just document existence.

```

---

## 22. Dart and Flutter Target Support

Status: documented in `docs/dart-flutter-target.md`; parser/backend support remains pending.

LogicN should support Dart and Flutter as layered target outputs without becoming a
Flutter framework.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
Dart = target language
Flutter = external UI framework/package ecosystem
Skia and Impeller = rendering backend concerns to report, not core LogicN syntax
```

Documented design direction:

```text
sync by default
async flow only when declared
await only inside async flows
async flows may appear anywhere normal flows are allowed
Bytes as portable LogicN byte data
Dart.Uint8List only at explicit Dart/Flutter interop boundaries
vector compute separate from async IO
Flutter support through generated Dart package output first
Flutter package/plugin output after Dart logic package output
platform-channel contracts as explicit interop boundaries
Pigeon-style typed platform API generation as optional tooling
Flutter FFI/native-library output for compute-heavy code
permission metadata and source maps for generated Flutter artefacts
Flutter UI component syntax as later-stage research
Skia/Impeller assumptions reported, not hard-coded
```

Pending implementation examples:

```text
parse async flow
reject await outside async flow
lower async flow to Dart Future
add target dart reports
add target flutter reports
add Flutter-compatible package output layout
add Bytes to Dart.Uint8List conversion checks

bridges and adapter manifests without becoming those frameworks.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
JavaScript/TypeScript = target output and interop layer
Node = runtime target
React/Angular = external framework adapter targets
WASM = browser/Node compute module target
```

Documented design direction:

```text
prefer ESM JavaScript output for modern framework interop
generate TypeScript declarations for LogicN exports
generate JSON Schema and OpenAPI from LogicN types/contracts
support browser and Node WASM bridges
support Node worker-compatible compute modules

## 24. Device Capability Boundaries

Status: documented in `docs/device-capability-boundaries.md`; parser/runtime
support remains pending.

LogicN should support the safe foundations for phone and device features without
making camera, microphone, GPS, Bluetooth, notifications, media players, phone
radios or mobile UI native language features.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
Device features = packages, platform bindings, OS APIs, drivers or frameworks
Mobile UI/app lifecycle = frameworks
Raw/privileged device access = blocked by default
```

Documented design direction:

```text
support Bytes, Buffer<T>, Stream<T>, ImageData, AudioData, SignalData, Tensor<T>, Vector<T> and Matrix<T>
support permissions and effects for device-facing packages
support async/event handling without becoming a UI framework
support compute targets such as CPU, GPU, NPU, DSP, WASM and mobile native
support runtime/hardware capability detection and safe fallback
support explicit unsafe external native/platform boundaries
report device permissions, privacy, native bindings and compute target assumptions
keep camera apps, photo galleries, FM radio, media players, GPS navigation, notifications and mobile UI out of core LogicN
```

Pending implementation examples:

```text
parse device permission declarations consistently
check device effects against declared permissions
reject core calls pretending to be built-in device APIs
emit device-capability-report.json
emit device-privacy-report.json
emit native-bindings-report.json for device/platform bindings

## 25. Text AI Package Boundaries and Compute Auto

Status: documented in `docs/text-ai-package-boundaries-and-compute-auto.md`;
parser/runtime/report support remains pending.

LogicN should safely support text AI packages, model providers and compute-heavy
text workflows without making text AI a native language feature.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
Text AI tasks = packages, model providers, frameworks, applications or external services
Generated text = data, not executable instructions
```

Documented design direction:

```text
support Text, Unicode handling, Locale, LanguageCode, typed inputs and typed outputs
support text_policy and token_policy configuration
support prompt_safety and text_redaction policy hooks
support package/provider boundaries for summarisation, generation, embeddings, translation, moderation, NLP and document AI
support compute auto for model-heavy text stages
keep loading, validation, prompt safety, redaction, final decisions and storage in CPU/exact logic
require network permissions for external providers
reject or strongly warn when generated text is executed directly
report token limits, memory, target selection, prompt safety, redaction and external provider use
```

Pending implementation examples:

## 26. Auth, Token and Verification Boundaries

Status: documented in `docs/auth-token-verification-boundaries.md`;
parser/runtime/report support remains pending.

LogicN should support modern authentication and authorisation standards through
safe typed verification boundaries without becoming an identity provider,
authentication product or cryptography framework.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
JWT, OAuth, bearer, DPoP and mTLS = established standards to validate safely
Identity provider, login UI, MFA product and session framework = packages/frameworks/external services
New cryptographic algorithms = out of scope
```

Documented design direction:

```text
treat BearerToken and JwtToken as SecureString values
verify JWT claims before use
require issuer, audience, expiry, signature and trusted key checks
deny algorithm "none" and untrusted algorithms by default
declare OAuth providers, JWKS, PKCE and token validation policy
support DPoP and mTLS sender-constrained token checks
support request proof envelopes for high-risk routes, queues and webhooks
support capability-token workflows bound to action, resource, nonce and request hash
support idempotency and replay protection for sensitive mutations
support post-quantum/hybrid crypto policy declarations without forcing them into normal code
mark hardware proof such as photonic PUFs as experimental policy/plugin work
generate auth, token, proof, crypto policy and security reports
```

Pending implementation examples:

```text
parse auth_policy
parse auth_provider
parse route auth blocks for bearer, provider and scopes
parse verify blocks for capability and request_proof requirements
parse DPoP and mTLS policy blocks
parse crypto_policy with classical, post_quantum and hybrid modes

## 27. API Data Security and Load Control

Status: documented in `docs/api-data-security-and-load-control.md`;
parser/runtime/report support remains pending.

LogicN should make API input safe before it reaches application logic without
becoming a web framework, load balancer or API gateway product.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
API data safety = typed contracts, policies, limits, reports and checks
HTTP server/router/load balancer/API gateway = packages/frameworks/external systems
Queue and rate-limit storage = packages/frameworks/external systems
```

Documented design direction:

```text
decode API input into strict request types
validate Content-Type before decoding
enforce body size, depth, node and string limits
deny unknown fields and duplicate JSON keys where configured
deny unsafe implicit type coercion by default
support safe payload identification without bypassing route policy
support per-route rate, concurrency, timeout and memory budgets
support trusted-proxy rules for X-Forwarded-For and source IP decisions
support streaming request bodies with bounded buffers
support read-only request references and request-scoped lifetime checks
support queue handoff for heavy routes

## 28. API Duplicate Detection and Idempotency

Status: documented in `docs/api-duplicate-detection-and-idempotency.md`;
parser/runtime/report support remains pending.

LogicN should detect duplicate API structure at check/build time and help control
duplicate side effects through idempotency, replay protection and reports
without becoming a web framework or API gateway.

Required boundary:

```text
LogicN = language and compiler/toolchain
Duplicate API safety = declarations, checks, manifests, idempotency metadata and reports
Routing/controller/middleware/API gateway = packages/frameworks/external systems
Idempotency storage = packages/frameworks/external systems
```

Documented design direction:

```text
detect duplicate method/path declarations as errors
detect duplicate route names as errors or warnings
warn about duplicate request/response type shapes
allow intentionally same type shapes with explicit annotation
generate app.api-manifest.json
support idempotency blocks with key, TTL, conflict and payload mismatch policy
recommend idempotency from side-effecting route effects
support explicit idempotency exceptions with reasons
require webhook replay protection and idempotency keys in strict/release modes
warn about duplicate external API clients

emit app.duplicate-api-report.json
emit app.idempotency-report.json
add map-manifest route/webhook duplicate metadata
add AI guide API duplicate/idempotency summaries
```

## Final Principle

LogicN should become more than a language that runs code.

It should become a language/toolchain that can:

```text
run quickly during development
compile for production
generate trusted explanations
reduce AI token use
avoid hidden memory costs
handle JSON efficiently
produce security reports
produce source maps
produce API documentation
prepare for future compute targets
```

Final rule:

```text
Run fast while developing.
Generate explanations while checking.
Compile fully before deploying.
```
