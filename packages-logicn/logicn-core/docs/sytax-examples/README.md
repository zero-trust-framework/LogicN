# LogicN Syntax Examples

This folder contains one-file-per-feature examples showing how to use LogicN syntax and how not to use it.

The folder name is currently `docs/sytax-examples/` to match the active `docs/sytax/` request. If the project later standardises on `syntax`, move both folders together.

---

## Rule

When adding or changing LogicN syntax, update:

```text
docs/sytax/<feature>.md
docs/sytax-examples/<feature>.md
docs/syntax.md
docs/feature-status.md
docs/pending-additions.md
TODO.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

Each examples file should include:

```text
good examples
bad examples
why the bad examples are unsafe or inefficient
expected diagnostics or reports
```
