# LogicN Security Risk Feature Ranking

LogicN has two linked goals:

```text
1. Be a clear, pleasant language for developers to write.
2. Be structured enough for AI tools to understand, review and safely change.
```

The security goal should be close to fail-closed by default:

```text
Make unsafe behaviour hard to write.
Make risky behaviour explicit.
Make every risky boundary reportable.
Make generated code traceable back to LogicN source.
```

No language can honestly promise perfect security, but LogicN can reduce preventable
security defects by combining strict syntax, memory safety, typed effects,
permissions, reports, checked execution and AI-readable diagnostics.

## Risk Scale

| Rank | Name        | Meaning                                      | Default stance                                  |
| ---: | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | Protective  | Reduces security risk                        | Core/default                                    |
| 1    | Low         | Safe when implemented normally               | Core/default                                    |
| 2    | Medium      | Needs compiler checks and clear diagnostics  | Allowed with checks                             |
| 3    | High        | Needs explicit policy, limits and reports    | Allowed only with guardrails                    |
| 4    | Critical    | Can break isolation, memory safety or trust  | Denied by default; explicit boundary only       |
| X    | Unsupported | Should not exist in normal LogicN                | Reject; migration or engine-lab discussion only |

Rule:

```text
Risk rank 3 or higher must produce a report.
Risk rank 4 must require explicit permission.
Risk X must be rejected in normal LogicN code.
```

## Deny By Default Top Risks

The following features are denied by default in normal LogicN code:

```text
1. Dynamic eval / runtime code execution
2. Unrestricted shell execution
3. Hidden network access
4. Raw filesystem access
5. Global mutable variables
6. Unsafe native interop
7. Raw pointers / unchecked memory
8. Monkey patching
9. Reflection that bypasses policy
10. AI self-granting capabilities
```

If supported at all, they require:

```text
declared effect
+ capability
+ policy approval
+ audit record
```

Complexity features to leave out of the core runtime include inheritance-heavy
object models, multiple inheritance, heavy reflection, dynamic typing as the
main model, hidden magic decorators, automatic global dependency injection,
unbounded runtime background work, implicit async behaviour and a large default
framework bundled into the runtime.

The design rule is:

```text
No hidden power.
No hidden mutation.
No hidden execution.
No hidden cost.
```

---

## Security Baseline

Every feature should be assessed against these baseline requirements:

```text
strict types
no undefined
no silent null
no truthy/falsy branching
no loose implicit coercion
no unbounded memory by default
no hidden global state
no secret logging
source maps for generated output
machine-readable diagnostics
security reports
target/fallback reports
AI-readable guide output
```

## Memory and Resource Safety Ranking

Memory safety deserves several independent failsafes. A single check is not
enough.

| Feature / area                  | Risk | Main risk                                  | LogicN default                         | Required checks / failsafes                          |

| Streams                         | 3    | Unclosed handles, backpressure failure     | Allowed                            | `Result`, cancellation, close-on-scope-exit          |

| General-purpose GC              | 3    | Hidden pauses, root leaks, hard reporting  | Not required early                 | If added later: GC reports, roots report, leak mode  |

### Required Memory Failsafes

LogicN should layer memory checks:

```text
1. Compile-time lifetime and escape checks.
2. Definite assignment checks.
3. No raw pointers in normal code.
4. Resource scopes for files, sockets, streams and FFI handles.
5. Per-flow and per-request memory budgets.
6. Bounded collections by default for API, queue and batch work.
7. Leak detection in checked Run Mode.
8. Memory-pressure reports in build/dev output.
9. Source-mapped allocation diagnostics.
10. FFI ownership reports for native boundaries.
11. Cache size and TTL policies.
12. Fail-closed behaviour when memory budgets are exceeded.
```

Recommended compiler/runtime error shape:

```text
logicn-MEM-LEAK-001: Resource may escape its cleanup scope.

Resource:
  uploadStream

Source:
  src/uploads/process.lln:18:5

Suggested fix:
  keep the stream inside a resource scope or return Bytes/Result instead.
```

## AI-Readable Security Requirements

LogicN should be easy for AI to understand without making security weaker.

AI-friendly features should be ranked as protective only when they preserve exact
semantics.

Required AI safety rules:

```text
syntax should be regular and explicit
formatter should produce stable layout
diagnostics should have stable IDs
errors should include suggested safe fixes
generated code should preserve source maps
security reports should be machine-readable
AI summaries should not include secrets
AI guides should distinguish implemented features from proposals
AI-generated changes should be checkable by compiler reports
```

Unsupported AI shortcuts:

```text
silent source rewriting
hidden framework magic
implicit imports
automatic permission grants
automatic unsafe boundary creation
invented provider capabilities
secret printing in AI summaries
```

---

## Fail-Closed Rules

LogicN should fail closed when a feature is risky and unclear.

```text
If memory ownership is unclear, reject.
If null handling is unclear, reject.
If a secret may be logged, reject.
If a compute target cannot prove fallback, reject or report unsupported.
If a package requests native bindings silently, reject.
If browser storage receives SecureString, reject.
If JSON has duplicate keys, reject by default.
If a webhook lacks replay protection, reject by default.
If an AI confidence controls security directly, reject.
If eval or shell execution appears in normal LogicN, reject.
```

## Minimum Reports By Risk Level

| Risk | Required output                                      |
| ---: | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 0-1  | Normal diagnostics                                   |
| 2    | Diagnostics for unsafe use                           |
| 3    | Security or target report entry                      |
| 4    | Explicit permission, source map and audit report     |
| X    | Compiler error with migration/safe alternative notes |

Example report fields:

```json
{
  "feature": "native_bindings",
  "risk": 4,
  "status": "denied_by_default",
  "source": "boot.lln:22",
  "reason": "Native bindings can bypass LogicN memory safety.",
  "required_policy": "trusted package, ownership report, platform report"
}
```

---

## Implementation Priority

Security implementation should follow this order:

```text
1. Strict parser and clear diagnostics.
2. No undefined, no silent null and no truthy/falsy checks.
3. Option and Result enforcement.
4. Memory scope and resource cleanup checks.
5. SecureString redaction and no-log checks.
6. JSON duplicate/unknown/null policy.
7. API body, route, webhook and idempotency checks.
8. Package permissions and native binding denial.
9. Target and fallback reports.
10. Leak detection in checked Run Mode.
11. FFI ownership reports.
12. AI-readable security summaries.
```

---

## Final Rule

LogicN should be nice to write because safe code is the shortest path.

LogicN should be easy for AI to understand because every risky feature is explicit,
typed, source-mapped and reported.

The core rule:

```text
Developer-friendly syntax.
AI-readable structure.
Security-first semantics.
Fail-closed boundaries.
Multiple memory-safety checks.
```
