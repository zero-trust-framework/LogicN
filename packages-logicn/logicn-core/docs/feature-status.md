# LogicN Feature Status

This document defines standard status labels for LogicN features.

The goal is to make the project clear as it grows, so readers can distinguish current prototype behaviour from draft design, planned compiler work and future research.

---

## Status Labels

Use these labels consistently:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Implemented` | Works in the current prototype or repository as described |
| `Prototype` | Partially working; useful for experiments but not production-ready |
| `Draft` | Documented design direction, syntax or policy may still change |
| `Planned` | Intended future work, not implemented yet |
| `Research` | Exploratory idea, hardware/backend-dependent or uncertain |
| `Blocked` | Cannot progress until another feature or decision is completed |

Recommended rule:

```text
Every major LogicN feature should be labelled Implemented, Prototype, Draft, Planned, Research or Blocked.
```

## Documentation Rule

When adding a major new LogicN concept, update:

```text
docs/feature-status.md
docs/pending-additions.md
docs/sytax/ when syntax is added or changed
docs/sytax-examples/ when syntax examples are added or changed
TODO.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

If a feature has examples that the current parser cannot compile, keep those examples in documentation or future-syntax areas until parser support exists.

---

## Final Rule

```text
Do not make planned or research features look implemented.
Label the status clearly.
```
