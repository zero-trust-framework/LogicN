# Contributing to LogicN / LogicN

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **LogicN / LogicN**.

LogicN is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and accelerator-aware programming language concept.

This document explains how to contribute to the project, what kinds of contributions are useful, and what rules should be foLOwed when suggesting changes.

---

## Project Status

LogicN is currently in the concept and documentation stage.

The current focus is:

```text
language design
syntax examples
requirements
architecture
security model
JSON/API design
AI-friendly tooling
source-map design
build output design
Git workflow
future compiler planning
```

A production compiler does not exist yet.

Contributions should be written with this in mind.

---

## Ways to Contribute

Useful contributions include:

```text
improving documentation
suggesting clearer syntax
finding contradictions in the design
improving security rules
improving JSON/API examples
improving webhook examples
improving compiler architecture
drafting source-map schemas
drafting report schemas
drafting example .lln files
reviewing licence and attribution files
improving Git/deployment guidance
```

---

## Contribution Priorities

Contributions should support one or more of these goals:

```text
make LogicN safer
make LogicN stricter
make LogicN easier to understand
make LogicN better for JSON/API systems
make LogicN better for webhooks
make LogicN easier to debug
make LogicN more AI-friendly
make LogicN easier to deploy
make LogicN ready for multi-target compilation
make LogicN useful before future hardware arrives
```

---

## Core Project Rules

Do not make changes that break the core LogicN direction.

LogicN must keep these rules:

```text
No undefined.
No silent null.
No unsafe memory by default.
No hidden errors.
No loose truthy/falsy logic.
No implicit type coercion.
No compiled secrets.
No unreported target fallback.
No runtime error without source mapping.
No requirement for photonic hardware.
```

---

## File Extension Rule

LogicN source files must use:

```text
.lln
```

Use:

```text
boot.lln
main.lln
hello.lln
order-service.lln
payment-webhook.lln
```

## Good First Contributions

Good first contributions include:

```text
fixing spelling and grammar
improving examples
adding missing explanations
adding glossary terms
improving README sections
adding TODO items
adding security notes
adding JSON/API examples
adding webhook examples
adding source-map examples
adding AI context examples
```

---

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation should be:

```text
clear
structured
example-led
plain but technical
consistent with existing terminology
honest about what exists and what is planned
```

Avoid:

```text
marketing hype
unsupported claims
over-promising hardware support
claiming a compiler exists before it does
claiming LogicN makes all software secure automatically
```

Use future-facing language carefully:

```text
should
could
planned
proposed
future version
initial prototype
```

---

## Code Contributions

When compiler/runtime/tooling code exists, code contributions should foLOw these principles:

```text
safe by default
well tested
clear errors
source-map aware
report-aware
security-aware
AI-context aware
```

Compiler code should preserve:

```text
file names
line numbers
column numbers
source-map traceability
security report output
failure report output
target report output
```

---

## Example Contributions

Examples should be short, safe and clear.

Good examples should include:

```text
strict types
explicit errors
Option<T> for missing values
Result<T, Error> for failures
Decision for 3-way business/security logic
safe JSON decoding
safe API/webhook configuration
source-map friendly errors
```

Avoid examples that:

```text
use undefined
use silent null
log secrets
use loose typing
place file/network I/O inside compute blocks
ignore webhook verification
ignore idempotency
hide errors
```

---

## JSON Contributions

LogicN is JSON-native but strict.

When contributing JSON examples, prefer:

```LogicN
let input: CreateOrderRequest = json.decode<CreateOrderRequest>(req.body)
```

Raw JSON is aLOwed when needed:

```LogicN
let raw: Json = req.json()
let eventType: String = raw.path("$.type").asString()
```

Production examples should prefer typed JSON decoding.

---

## API Contributions

API examples should usually include:

```text
typed request
typed response
declared errors
timeout
max body size
handler
```

Example:

```LogicN
api OrdersApi {
  POST "/orders" {
    request CreateOrderRequest
    response CreateOrderResponse
    errors [ValidationError, PaymentError]
    timeout 5s
    max_body_size 1mb
    handler createOrder
  }
}
```

---

## Webhook Contributions

Webhook examples should be secure by default.

Include:

```text
HMAC verification
secret from environment
max age
max body size
replay protection
idempotency key
handler
```

Example:

```LogicN
webhook PaymentWebhook {
  path "/webhooks/payment"
  method POST

  security {
    hmac_header "Payment-Signature"
    secret env.secret("PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET")
    max_age 5m
    max_body_size 512kb
    replay_protection true
  }

  idempotency_key json.path("$.id")
  handler handlePaymentWebhook
}
```

---

## Security Contributions

Security-related contributions are especially welcome.

Useful areas:

```text
threat model
SecureString behaviour
secret redaction
permission model
effect system
package permissions
webhook security
JSON safety limits
source-map security
AI context redaction
deployment security
```

Security changes should be clearly documented in:

```text
SECURITY.md
CHANGELOG.md
```

---

## AI-Friendly Contributions

LogicN should be friendly to AI coding assistants.

Useful contributions include:

```text
AI-INSTRUCTIONS.md updates
LogicN ai-context schema ideas
LogicN explain --for-ai examples
machine-readable report schemas
token-efficient summaries
source-map explanation examples
AI-safe redaction rules
```

AI output must not include secrets.

---

## Source Map Contributions

Source maps are essential to LogicN.

Contributions should preserve the ability to map compiled output errors back to original `.lln` source.

Source-map examples should include:

```text
original file
original line
original column
flow/function name
target output
build stage
suggested fix
```

---

## Target Contributions

LogicN targets should be handled carefully.

Current target concepts:

```text
binary
wasm
gpu-plan
photonic-plan
ternary-sim
```

Do not make photonic hardware mandatory.

Photonic support should begin as:

```text
planning
validation
simulation
reporting
fallback design
```

GPU support should be included because GPU hardware is available today.

---

## Issue Guidelines

Good issues should include:

```text
clear title
what file or area is affected
what is confusing or missing
suggested improvement if possible
example if relevant
```

Example issue title:

```text
Clarify difference between Decision and Tri
```

Example issue body:

```text
The docs mention Decision and Tri, but the difference could be clearer.
Decision seems intended for business/security logic.
Tri seems intended for mathematical or signal/model logic.
Suggest adding a comparison table.
```

---

## Design Discussion Guidelines

When proposing a design change, explain:

```text
what problem it solves
why LogicN needs it
how it affects strict typing
how it affects security
how it affects JSON/API design
how it affects source maps
how it affects AI tooling
how it affects CPU fallback
```

Avoid design changes that only make the language look different without solving a real problem.

## Licence for Contributions

LogicN is intended to use the **Apache License 2.0**.

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contribution may be included under the Apache License 2.0.

You must have the right to submit your contribution.

Do not submit code, documentation or examples copied from sources with incompatible licences.

---

## AI-Assisted Contributions

AI-assisted contributions are aLOwed if they are reviewed carefully.

Contributors are responsible for checking:

```text
accuracy
licence compatibility
security impact
consistency with LogicN rules
clarity
no copied proprietary content
no real secrets
```

AI-assisted output should not be committed blindly.

---

## Attribution

Preserve attribution to the original LogicN / LogicN project.

Forks and modified versions should not imply they are official unless approved.

Recommended wording for forks:

```text
This project is based on LogicN / LogicN but is not the official LogicN project.
```

---

## What Not To Contribute

Avoid contributions that:

```text
make LogicN loosely typed
add undefined
add silent null
remove Result/Option handling
remove source maps
remove CPU compatibility
make photonic hardware required
start kernel or driver development without explicit maintainer approval
ignore JSON/API use cases
ignore webhook security
compile secrets into outputs
claim LogicN is production-ready before it is
```

Kernel modules, operating-system drivers, privileged native bindings, vendor SDK
driver bindings and raw hardware access are last-stage work. Do not contribute
designs, examples, stubs or implementation for them unless maintainers have
approved that work first.

---

## Review Priorities

Maintainers should review contributions in this order:

```text
1. Does it preserve safety?
2. Does it preserve strict typing?
3. Does it improve clarity?
4. Does it help real JSON/API use cases?
5. Does it keep LogicN useful without future hardware?
6. Does it support source-mapped debugging?
7. Does it support AI-friendly tooling?
8. Does it avoid unsupported claims?
```

---

## Documentation Style

Use:

```text
headings
short paragraphs
code examples
tables where helpful
clear labels
consistent terminology
```

Avoid:

```text
overly long paragraphs
vague claims
unsupported performance promises
unexplained acronyms
```

---

## Current Priority Areas

The current highest-value contribution areas are:

```text
syntax clarity
JSON-native design
API-native design
webhook security
source-map schema
compiler report schema
AI context schema
architecture consistency
security model
Git/deployment documentation
```

---

## Final Note

LogicN should be practical first and future-facing second.

The best contributions make LogicN:

```text
safer
clearer
more useful
easier to debug
better for APIs and JSON
better for AI tools
ready for future compute
```
