# LogicN TODO

This document lists the working TODO items for **LogicN / LogicN**.

LogicN is a strict, memory-safe, security-first, JSON-native, API-native and accelerator-aware programming language concept.

Use this file as a practical checklist while the project moves from concept to documentation, prototype and implementation.

## V1 Package Freeze And Core Focus

```text
[ ] Freeze non-essential package expansion while core syntax and grammar are defined
[ ] Keep v1 target scope to CPU and WASM
[ ] Treat GPU, AI accelerator, photonic, optical I/O and domain packages as post-v1
[ ] Work actively on core syntax, grammar and logic semantics
[ ] Commit the hybrid ownership memory-safety model
[ ] Finalise Bool, Tri, Decision, Option and Result semantics
[x] Add at least 20 real .lln examples for the v1 syntax subset
[ ] Build parser coverage for those examples
[ ] Reject post-v1 syntax with clear diagnostics
[ ] Use docs/language-core-maturity-roadmap.md as the maturity checklist before
    claiming production maturity
```

[!] Kernel and driver development must be last-stage work and requires explicit maintainer permission
[!] Full memory model requires deeper compiler design
[!] Package manager should wait until syntax stabilises
[!] Formal verification should wait until core language model is stable
```

## Final TODO Principle

Every TODO item should support at least one of these aims:

```text
make LogicN safer
make LogicN stricter
make LogicN easier to debug
make LogicN better for JSON/API systems
make LogicN better for AI coding assistants
make LogicN easier to deploy
make LogicN ready for multi-target compilation
make LogicN useful before future hardware arrives
```
