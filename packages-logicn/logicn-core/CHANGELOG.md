## Changelog Format

This project should foLOw a simple changelog format:

```text
## [Version] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security
### Notes
```

Recommended categories:

| Category | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Added` | New features, files, syntax ideas or documents |
| `Changed` | Updates to existing design or documentation |
| `Deprecated` | Ideas that are still mentioned but should not be used |
| `Removed` | Ideas or files that have been removed |
| `Fixed` | Corrections, typo fixes or clarified rules |
| `Security` | Security-related changes |
| `Notes` | General project notes |

## Versioning

LogicN should use semantic versioning once implementation starts.

Format:

```text
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

Example:

```text
0.1.0
```

During the concept stage, versions may represent documentation and design milestones rather than production software.

Example:

```text
0.1.0 = concept documentation
0.2.0 = parser prototype
0.3.0 = type checker prototype
0.4.0 = JSON/API prototype
0.5.0 = target planning prototype
```

### Changed

```text
- Clarified that LogicN starts with ternary support but should remain future-compatible with wider multi-state logic systems.
- Clarified that compiler, runtime, schemas and documentation should use logic-width terminology where behaviour is not ternary-only.
- Clarified that LogicN diagnostics should use predictable warning, error and fatal code formats.
- Clarified that generated explanation does not require production compilation.
- Clarified that production artefacts require Compile Mode.
- Clarified why LogicN uses `flow` instead of `function`, `def` or `fn`.
- Clarified README prototype status, implemented command coverage and generated-output locations.
- Updated GETTING_STARTED.md from planned-only guidance to the current v0.1 prototype workflow.
- Updated docs/README.md with the runnable prototype entry points and generated documentation outputs.
- Updated docs/run-and-compile-modes.md with current prototype build commands and report output lists.
- Updated docs/pending-logicn-additions.md as a current planning snapshot with prototype status and recent package, vector and wavelength concepts.
- Refactored search and translation wording so LogicN provides safe package/provider boundaries instead of native search, translation, vector search, image search or provider SDK features.
- Refactored video wording so LogicN provides safe file, stream, effect, privacy, memory and compute boundaries instead of native video processing, codec, AI, camera or streaming features.
- Clarified roadmap and README wording so larger application support means package/convention support, not LogicN becoming an MVC or web framework.
- Clarified that direct Flutter UI/component syntax is a later-stage research layer, not the first Flutter support target.
- Clarified that React, Angular, Node, Express/Fastify and similar ecosystems should be supported through generated outputs and adapters, not by baking framework syntax into LogicN core.
- Clarified that camera, microphone, Bluetooth, GPS, notifications, media players, phone radios and mobile UI belong in packages/platform bindings/frameworks, not LogicN core.
- Clarified that text summarisation, generation, embeddings, moderation, translation, document AI and NLP tasks belong in packages/providers/frameworks, not LogicN core.
- Clarified that JWT, OAuth, bearer tokens, DPoP and mTLS should be safer typed verification workflows around established standards, not an LogicN identity provider or new cryptography system.
- Clarified that API data security and load control are language/toolchain policy and report concerns, while HTTP servers, web frameworks, load balancers, API gateways, queue backends and rate-limit stores remain outside LogicN core.
- Clarified that API duplicate detection and idempotency are compiler/toolchain safety checks and metadata, while actual routing and idempotency storage remain framework/package territory.
- Added a documentation rule that syntax changes should update the per-feature files under docs/sytax/.
- Added a documentation rule that syntax examples should be updated under docs/sytax-examples/ alongside docs/sytax/.
- Corrected compiler and examples README command paths for running from the repository root.
- Reduced repeated README prototype status content by keeping the top status section authoritative.
- Added README repository-root structure showing source directories and generated output directories.
- Updated README licence notice to reference the existing Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, `LICENCE.md` and `NOTICE.md` files.
- Added README JSON-native examples for partial extraction, views, redaction, streaming and Lazy Compact JSON.
- Added README API-native examples for route contracts, typed handlers and schema/OpenAPI prototype commands.
- Added README webhook example details for typed events, verification order, idempotency and generated reports.
- Changed diagnostic console output to include LogicN diagnostic code and recovery action.
- Changed source file extension from the early `.language` idea to `.lln`.
- Changed project entry concept from `main.language` to `boot.lln` / `main.lln`.
- Changed photonic support from direct required hardware support to planning and validation first.
- Changed ternary support from general replacement for booleans to specific 3-way logic and decision modelling.
- Changed AI support from vague AI-friendliness to explicit AI context and AI explanation files.
- Changed JSON support from normal library feature to first-class language concern.
- Changed API/webhook support from framework-level idea to language/compiler-level concern.
```

### Deprecated

```text
- Deprecated `.language` as a source file extension.
- Deprecated `main.language` as a project registry file.
- Deprecated JavaScript-style `undefined`.
- Deprecated silent null behaviour.
- Deprecated loose truthy/falsy checks.
- Deprecated implicit type coercion.
- Deprecated the idea that LogicN requires photonic hardware to be useful.
```

### Removed

```text
- Removed early suggestion that imports should use names like `import 3way`.
- Removed early `.language` naming from current examples.
```

### Security

```text
- Added rule that real secrets must not be compiled into output files.
- Added `SecureString` concept.
- Added secret redaction requirement for logs and AI context files.
- Added webhook HMAC verification concept.
- Added replay protection requirement for webhooks.
- Added idempotency key requirement for webhooks.
- Added bearer-token, JWT, OAuth, DPoP, mTLS, request-proof and capability-token verification boundary planning.
- Added rule that LogicN must not invent new cryptography and should instead wrap proven cryptography in typed verification workflows and reports.
- Added experimental framing for hardware proof such as photonic PUFs and policy-only framing for post-quantum/hybrid crypto options.
- Added API input safety planning for strict request decoding, unknown-field denial, unsafe coercion denial, request-scoped memory, trusted proxy checks, rate limits, concurrency limits, backpressure and overload rejection.
- Added API duplicate/idempotency safety planning for duplicate route detection, duplicate type warnings, idempotency reports, webhook replay protection, duplicate external client warnings and effect-based idempotency recommendations.
- Added package permission concept.
- Added effect system concept.
- Added unsafe denied-by-default requirement.
```

### Notes

```text
- LogicN is currently a concept and documentation project.
- No production compiler exists yet.
- No real GPU or photonic backend exists yet.
- Early GPU and photonic support should be represented as plan/report outputs.
- CPU compatibility should remain essential.
```

## Final Note

This changelog tracks LogicN as it evolves from concept to implementation.

At this stage, most entries describe design decisions and planned milestones rather than released software.

Once a compiler or toolchain exists, this file should track real releases, bug fixes, security updates and compatibility changes.
