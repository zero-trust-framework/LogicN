/**
 * Verify/run-side PQ FLOOR (consume side) — regression test for the one-directional
 * PQ-downgrade fail-open closed 2026-06-24 (logicn.mjs `verify` command + run-admission).
 *
 * The SIGN side already mandates a hybrid Ed25519+ML-DSA-65 manifest under
 * LOGICN_MANIFEST_PROFILE=certified (see cli-hybrid-signing-roundtrip.test.mjs). Before this
 * fix the CONSUME side did NOT: a v1 (Ed25519-only) manifest was ACCEPTED by `verify`/`run`
 * even under a PQ-required posture — a classical downgrade slipped straight through. This test
 * locks the closure on the authoritative `verify` path (which == the deploy pipeline's
 * build-verify step):
 *
 *   (1) keygen (CLASSICAL) + build (non-certified)  → a real v1 Ed25519-only manifest
 *   (2) verify, DEFAULT posture (no env)            → exit 0   (default consume UNCHANGED)
 *   (3) verify, LOGICN_MANIFEST_PROFILE=certified   → exit 1, LLN-MANIFEST-PQ-REQUIRED (fail-closed)
 *   (4) verify, LOGICN_MANIFEST_PROFILE=certifed    → unrecognized → fail-secure to certified:
 *                                                     warn + exit 1 (a typo NEVER drops the PQ mandate)
 *
 * Uses the EXISTING dist (no rebuild) — same posture as cli-hybrid-signing-roundtrip.test.mjs.
