// Repo hygiene guard: a literal NUL byte (0x00) in a source file makes git AND ripgrep/grep treat the
// whole file as BINARY — so it is silently skipped by every text search and shows no line-diff. For a
// security-critical file (e.g. the P9 WASM admission gate) that means audits invisibly miss it. The fix
// is always to use the `\0` escape, which is byte-identical at runtime but keeps the source as text.
// This test fails on any NEW source file that introduces NUL bytes, so the class can't recur.
//
// Found 2026-06-21: wasm-runtime.ts had literal NULs (fixed); kernel.ts + inference manifest.ts still do
// but are FRAMEWORK files held for owner approval — allowlisted below until that byte-identical fix lands.
