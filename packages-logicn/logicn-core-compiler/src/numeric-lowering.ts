/**
 * numeric-lowering.ts — shared numeric type/literal utilities for faithful 64-bit lowering.
 *
 * Two pure helpers consulted across the value-state gate, the interpreter, the WASM emitter, and the
 * type-checker so every tier agrees on (a) the BASE type of an annotation string and (b) the exact
 * bigint value + range edges of an integer LITERAL. Per the verified i64-lowering plan
 * (docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-i64-lowering-plan-verified-2026-06-25.md) Step 0: ONE `numericBaseType`
 * + ONE `parseI64Literal` feeding two tier-specific origination hooks, so the I64_MIN/I64_MAX literal
 * edges can never DIVERGE between tiers — a divergence is a silent 64→32 truncation fail-open (CWE-704),
 * exactly what `LLN-NUMERIC-001` gates against.
 *
 * NEVER parse an Int64 literal with `parseInt()` / `Number()` — they round above 2^53, which is the
 * precise fail-open. `BigInt` is exact across the whole i64 range.

/**
 * The scalar 64-bit widths the LLN-NUMERIC-001 GATE rejects: a value the *compile/admit* pipeline cannot
 * carry faithfully, so declaring one fails closed at check / build / governed-run (value-state-checker).
 *
 * Int64 has been LIFTED (owner-gated, 2026-06-25): the WASM emitter now lowers it faithfully (i64.const /
 * checked $lln_*_i64 / native i64.div_s|rem_s / i64 comparisons) and the tree-walker carries it as a
 * bigint — proven byte-exact, walker ≡ WASM, over the full (2^53,2^63) corpus (wat-i64-differential). So
 * the gate no longer rejects Int64; only UInt64 remains, because faithful *unsigned* 64-bit arithmetic
 * (u64 div/compare/overflow differ from the signed i64.* ops) has no layer yet. Int8/Int16 widen to i32
 * and Float32 widens to f64 (no value loss) — deliberately NOT here.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY SPLIT from FAST_TIER_UNLOWERABLE_SCALAR below: the two concerns diverged at the lift. The
 * GATE asks "can the pipeline as a whole carry this width?" (Int64: yes, via WASM/walker). The fast-tier
 * bail asks "can the *i32-only* fast tiers carry it?" (Int64: NO — they would silently truncate). Folding
 * them back into one set would either re-gate Int64 or let a fast tier truncate it — both fail-open.

 * declaring any of these (param, return, OR an internal `let y: Int64` the bytecode per-param check misses)
 * bails to the faithful tree-walker (which carries int64 as a bigint) / the i64-faithful WASM emitter.
