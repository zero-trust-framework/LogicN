// fix-edit.ts — the safe edit primitive for `logicn fix` (#56, the owner's #1 DX win).
//
// A diagnostic can carry a precise, machine-applicable `FixEdit` (a single-line span replacement). This module
// is the SAFE APPLIER: pure, no I/O, deny-by-default on anything ambiguous. The caller (the CLI `--fix-confirm`
// path) is responsible for re-parsing the result and only writing when the fixed source still compiles — this
// function never decides to write, it only computes the edited text.
//
// Safety rules (fail-safe — a questionable edit is SKIPPED, never misapplied):
//   • edits are applied in DESCENDING (line, column) order so earlier offsets are never shifted by later ones;
//   • OVERLAPPING edits on the same line are dropped (all but the first by sort order) — overlap means the
//     producers disagree about a region, so applying either blindly could corrupt the source;
//   • an edit whose span falls outside its line (bad column/endColumn) is skipped;
//   • a 1-based line beyond the source is skipped.
// The return value reports how many edits applied vs were skipped so the caller can surface "N of M applied".
