/**
 * partial-return.ts — K3 ternary partial-return / `Masked` per-field response shaper.
 *
 * TritMesh R&D 2026-06-23 net-new mechanic #2 (R&D 0108). Shipped masking is BINARY-only:
 * the governance-verifier rejects a leak (redact/seal/remove-field) and `view(cap1|cap2)`
 * yields a whole masked pointer — there is no THREE-valued, per-field partial return that
 * DENIES one field while RETURNING the rest. This adds it: each field of a response record
 * is admitted by its OWN K3 verdict (`decideAtBoundary`, fail-closed); authorized fields
 * pass through unchanged, and DENY / INDETERMINATE fields become a typed `Masked` sentinel
 * carrying the verdict + LLN-GOV-3VL-001 — keep-the-rest.
 *
 * Invariants (inherited verbatim from the K3 algebra in three-valued-governance.ts — NOT
 * re-proved here):
 *  - **Deny-by-default.** A field with NO verdict (`undefined`) or an EMPTY cap set folds to
 *    INDETERMINATE → withheld. A field is RETURNED iff its folded verdict is exactly ALLOW
 *    (`authorize` ⇔ +1). There is no path by which a non-allowed field leaks.
 *  - **Per-field vAnd fold.** Multiple actor caps on a field fold via `allOf` (Kleene ∧ = the
 *    most-cautious verdict wins); this can only LOWER a field, never lift it.
 *  - **Never silent.** An INDETERMINATE collapse carries LLN-GOV-3VL-001 in the `Masked`
 *    sentinel and to the optional `onDiagnostic` sink. This shapes GOVERNANCE only — it never
 *    transforms a value or touches crypto; an admitted value is returned byte-identical.
