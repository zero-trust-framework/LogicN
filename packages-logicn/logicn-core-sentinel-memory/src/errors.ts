// errors.ts — LSM trap types.
//
// The Sentinel Memory raises hard, named traps rather than returning error
// codes. A SecurityTrap is a deterministic memory-safety / governance fault
// (alignment, bounds, exhaustion, flight-lock, ternary corruption). A
// HardenedBorderViolation is raised when code attempts to cross a sealed
// boundary that is intentionally not wired in this build (e.g. an external
// photonic bus). Both carry a stable machine-readable `code`.
