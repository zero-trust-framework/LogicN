# record-allocation

Measures object/record creation overhead by allocating N simple structs with three numeric fields and summing two of them.

This is the #1 LogicN bottleneck: every value in the governed runtime is a `{__tag, value}` object, so raw allocation throughput directly impacts all other benchmarks.

## Algorithm

```
for i in 0..N:
  rec = { x: i, y: i*2, z: i+1 }
  sum += rec.x + rec.z
```

Default N: 200,000 (Node/Python/Rust/C++), 10,000 (LogicN — runner normalises to ops/second).
