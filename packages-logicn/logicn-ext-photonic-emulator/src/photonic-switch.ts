// photonic-switch.ts — the photonic-HARDWARE switch (the owner's "switchable separate package; keep
// digital, add a photonic-hardware switch").
//
// The photonic LANE runs behind the `PhotonicBackend` seam. Today the only backend is the Rung-2 EMULATOR
// (software, physics-faithful, honest deterministic=false). This switch lets a deployment select a REAL
// silicon backend WITHOUT changing anything else — but it is FAIL-CLOSED and KEEP-DIGITAL:
//   • DEFAULT is the emulator (software). Real hardware is never the silent default.
//   • Real hardware is admitted ONLY when it is present, reports nativeAvailable=true, AND is ATTESTED
//     (a verified backend-artifact attestation). Any miss → fall back to the emulator. We never run an
//     unverified PIC.
//   • KEEP-DIGITAL: the switch only chooses the PHOTONIC compute backend. Crypto, K3 governance, and
//     control stay on the digital core (the PartitionDecider already keeps crypto-on-core); the switch
//     never routes them through photonics.
//
// This is the runtime seam for the photonic-PPU-virtualisation ladder: Rung 2 = emulator (here today),
// Rung 3+ = an attested real-hardware backend slotted in behind the same interface.
