// errors.ts — LSS fault taxonomy.
//
// Two distinct failure classes, mirroring the Tower's existing vocabulary
// (sibling logicn-tower-citizen):
//
//   SecurityTrap            — an integrity violation was DETECTED. The data is
//                             present but cryptographically untrustworthy
//                             (tamper, corruption, wrong key). NEVER deserialise.
//   HardenedBorderViolation — a hardened precondition at the persistence border
//                             was breached (e.g. cold-boot expected a snapshot
//                             that does not exist). Fail closed.

/** Raised when a snapshot fails its integrity gate (checksum or HMAC). */
export class SecurityTrap extends Error {
