/**
 * #195 — OS/HW-compromised security posture.
 *
 * Part of the Zero Trust Framework bar ("OS/hardware treated as potentially
 * compromised, adaptively"). Posture is `off | auto | on`, default `auto`, and
 * `auto` is FAIL-SECURE: when the environment is production/staging or unknown
 * it resolves to `on`; only an explicit development/test environment relaxes to
 * `off`. `on` engages the hostile-host controls (distrust host clock/RNG,
 * require attestation, seal egress at the app layer, zeroize buffers after use).
 *
 * This module is pure config logic — it decides WHICH controls apply. Enforcing
 * them is the runtime/App Kernel's job (P1 consumes `resolvePosture`).
