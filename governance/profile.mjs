// governance/profile.mjs — the single, FAIL-SECURE resolver for GALERINA_PROFILE.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (audit, 2026-06-20):
//   The signing/admission gates (build signing key policy, `galerina verify`, `galerina run`) all key their
//   STRICT behaviour on "is this production?". Resolving that as `=== "production" ? "production" : "dev"`
//   is FAIL-OPEN: any value other than the exact string "production" (a typo like "prod" or "Production ",
//   "PRODUCTION", a stray space) silently resolves to dev — silently DISABLING every production gate. So an
//   operator who *intends* production but mis-spells the value gets throwaway-key dev signing with no error.
//
//   This resolver is FAIL-SECURE, mirroring core-config posture.ts (deriveImportProfile): only an UNSET/empty
//   value or an explicitly RECOGNIZED dev/test token relaxes to dev. Anything set-but-unrecognized resolves
//   to production (`failSecure: true`) so a malformed profile can never quietly turn enforcement off.
//
//   UNSET stays dev on purpose — that is the zero-touch local-development case (key-lifecycle auto-provisions
//   a dev key). The hazard being closed is a *set-but-wrong* value, not the absence of one.

// Explicitly-recognized dev/test tokens (plus unset/empty) that relax to the dev profile. Everything
// NOT in this set resolves to production; only the exact canonical "production" does so cleanly (without
// a fail-secure warning). A near-miss like "prod" / "staging" / a typo still resolves STRICT (production)
// but is flagged so the operator spells out the canonical value — strictness without silent surprises.
const DEV_TOKENS = new Set(["", "dev", "develop", "development", "test", "testing", "local"]);
