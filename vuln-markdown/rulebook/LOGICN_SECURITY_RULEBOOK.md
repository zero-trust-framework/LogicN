## Rules

## LN-SEC-2026-004: Untrusted Input Boundary Enforcement - CWE-20, RubyGems

Rulebook Status: `needs_human_review`
Recommended Action: `keep`
Action Reason: Evidence is sufficient for a standalone rulebook draft entry.
Evidence Score: `1.0`
Confidence Score: `0.7`
Merge Group: `deserialization-boundary`

### Governance Principle

Repeated injection findings indicate that untrusted input must not cross parser, query, or command boundaries without explicit validation and capability policy.

### LogicN Invariant

Untrusted values crossing interpreter, query, template, command, or parser boundaries require governed validation and typed capability approval.

### Generic Runtime Invariant

Track trust labels at runtime and audit untrusted-to-sensitive boundary crossings.

## Syntax Guidance

Require explicit trust annotations for values used in sensitive parser or query contexts.

## Compiler Guidance

Reject implicit flows from untrusted inputs into sensitive sinks without a validator or encoder contract.

## Runtime Guidance

Track trust labels at runtime and audit untrusted-to-sensitive boundary crossings.

## Deny Guidance

Deny execution when untrusted input reaches a sensitive sink without an approved capability.

## Audit Guidance

Audit validation decisions and sensitive sink invocations.

## Sandbox Guidance

Not proposed.

## Dependency Guidance

Not proposed.

Action Reason: Overlaps another proposed rule in the same governance boundary.
Evidence Score: `1.0`
Confidence Score: `0.7`
Merge Group: `request-intent-boundary`

### Governance Principle

Repeated CSRF findings indicate state-changing requests require explicit intent verification and request-boundary governance.

State-changing requests require actor intent, origin validation, and audit policy.

### Generic Runtime Invariant

Validate request origin and intent token before state mutation.

## Syntax Guidance

Require request intent policy on state-changing route declarations.

## LN-SEC-2026-007: Untrusted Input Boundary Enforcement - CWE-79, RubyGems

Rulebook Status: `needs_human_review`
Recommended Action: `merge`
Action Reason: Multiple Stage 3 proposals describe the same governance boundary.
Evidence Score: `1.0`
Confidence Score: `0.87`
Merge Group: `untrusted-input-boundary`

### Governance Principle

Repeated injection findings indicate that untrusted input must not cross parser, query, or command boundaries without explicit validation and capability policy.

### LogicN Invariant

Untrusted values crossing interpreter, query, template, command, or parser boundaries require governed validation and typed capability approval.

### Generic Runtime Invariant

Track trust labels at runtime and audit untrusted-to-sensitive boundary crossings.

## Syntax Guidance

Require explicit trust annotations for values used in sensitive parser or query contexts.

## Compiler Guidance

Reject implicit flows from untrusted inputs into sensitive sinks without a validator or encoder contract.

## Runtime Guidance

Track trust labels at runtime and audit untrusted-to-sensitive boundary crossings.

## Deny Guidance

Deny execution when untrusted input reaches a sensitive sink without an approved capability.

## Audit Guidance

Audit validation decisions and sensitive sink invocations.

## Sandbox Guidance

Not proposed.

## Dependency Guidance

## LN-SEC-2026-012: Native Boundary Isolation Requirement

Rulebook Status: `needs_human_review`
Recommended Action: `merge`
Action Reason: Overlaps another proposed rule in the same governance boundary.
Evidence Score: `1.0`
Confidence Score: `0.87`
Merge Group: `memory-safety-boundary`

### Governance Principle

Repeated memory-safety findings indicate that unsafe native boundaries should be isolated, audited, or replaced with memory-safe implementations.

### LogicN Invariant

Native or unsafe memory boundaries require explicit isolation and audit policy.

### Generic Runtime Invariant

Execute native extensions in isolated runtime zones when possible.

## Syntax Guidance

Require an unsafe/native boundary declaration for modules that cross memory-safe runtime boundaries.

## Compiler Guidance

Reject undeclared native boundary calls in governed runtime profiles.

## Runtime Guidance

Execute native extensions in isolated runtime zones when possible.

## Deny Guidance

Deny native boundary access from low-trust actors without a capability.

## Audit Guidance

Audit native boundary loads, calls, and crashes.

## Sandbox Guidance

Run native boundary code in a sandboxed execution zone.

## Dependency Guidance

Not proposed.

Recommended Action: `merge`
Action Reason: Multiple Stage 3 proposals describe the same governance boundary.
Evidence Score: `1.0`
Confidence Score: `0.87`
Merge Group: `filesystem-boundary`

### Governance Principle

Repeated path traversal findings indicate filesystem access must be governed by canonical paths, capabilities, and sandbox boundaries.

### LogicN Invariant

Filesystem operations require canonicalization and capability checks before crossing storage boundaries.

### Generic Runtime Invariant

Constrain filesystem access by actor capability and sandbox root.

## Syntax Guidance

Require explicit storage capability declarations for filesystem paths.

## Compiler Guidance

Reject untrusted path input to filesystem sinks without canonicalization contracts.

## Runtime Guidance

Constrain filesystem access by actor capability and sandbox root.

## Deny Guidance

Deny path traversal attempts outside the authorized storage boundary.

## Audit Guidance

Audit denied filesystem boundary crossings.

## Sandbox Guidance
