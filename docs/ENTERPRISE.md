# LogicN Enterprise Objectives

## Purpose

This document defines the LogicN free/open versus enterprise split.

The default rule is:

```text
Enterprise packages stay locked down and must not be built, activated, shipped
or treated as part of the active build graph until the project owner explicitly
says to unlock them.
```

For this repository, "unlock" means a direct instruction from the project owner
to start planning, implementing, building or integrating a named enterprise
package or feature area.

## Product Strategy

LogicN should keep the basic developer platform free/open and reserve advanced
governance, compliance, automation and managed-control layers for enterprise.

The commercial goal is:

```text
Free LogicN gets adoption.
Enterprise LogicN sells governance, compliance, deployment safety and
operational control.
```

Do not make whole technical areas enterprise-only when a basic version can help
individual developers and small teams adopt LogicN.

## Locked-Down Enterprise Rule

Enterprise-only packages and features must remain documentation/planning items
unless explicitly unlocked.

Enterprise-only package folders must live under:

```text
packages-logicn-enterprise/
```

They must not live under the active `packages-logicn/` package collection unless
explicitly unlocked and moved into the active workspace by the project owner.

AI coding tools must not:

- create enterprise package source code
- wire enterprise packages into builds
- add enterprise packages to production manifests
- add enterprise packages to default workspace profiles
- make free/open packages depend on enterprise packages
- implement enterprise-only runtime behavior under a free/open package name
- treat enterprise package names as active v1 build targets

AI coding tools may:

- document enterprise objectives
- document package names as reserved future enterprise names
- add TODOs or roadmap entries that clearly mark enterprise work as locked
- preserve basic/free equivalents where they are already in scope

## Free/Open Scope

logicn-security-basic
logicn-reports-basic
logicn-web

logicn-docs
```

Free/open LogicN should support:

- individual developers
- small teams

## Unlock Process

Before any enterprise package or feature is built, the project owner must
explicitly unlock it by name.

An unlock instruction should identify:

- the package or feature area being unlocked
- whether the work is planning-only, prototype-only or implementation-ready
- whether the package may be added to workspace manifests or build profiles
- which docs must be updated with the new enterprise boundary

Until that instruction exists, enterprise packages remain reserved names and
locked roadmap items only.
