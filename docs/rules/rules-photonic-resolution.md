# Rules: Photonic Resolution

Photonic and optical values may be useful compute outputs, but they must not
silently become application control flow.

## Core Rule

```text
Photonic and optical values cannot directly control application flow.
They must be measured, resolved or matched into classical LogicN values.
```

## Required Behavior

- `Bool` controls ordinary application flow.
- `Tri` models uncertainty.
- `PhotonicSignal` models light-based compute output.
- `resolve` or `measure` converts optical output into safe application decisions.
- Reports prove how resolution happened.
