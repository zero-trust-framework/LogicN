# Framework: Reports

## Purpose

Reports provide machine-readable proof of checked LogicN behavior.

## Short Definition

A report is generated evidence about contracts, policies, models, effects,
security, memory, routes, packages or runtime setup.

## Why It Exists

Reports make LogicN understandable to developers, reviewers, deployment tools
and AI agents without exposing secrets or relying on hidden runtime state.

## Report Families

```text
contract reports
policy reports
model reports
route reports
effect reports
security reports
crypto inventory reports
memory reports
AI context reports
MCP reports
runtime bridge reports
```

## Security Rules

- Reports must redact secrets.
- Reports must identify generated facts versus source-declared facts.
- Reports must not become a source of authority unless policy allows it.
- AI-safe reports must exclude private payloads and raw credentials.
- MCP reports must show tool, resource, prompt, token-boundary and vault access
  decisions without printing tokens or sensitive payloads.
- Crypto inventory reports must show algorithm purpose, policy state and
  post-quantum readiness without printing keys, seeds or tokens.

## v1 Scope

Stable report names, redaction rules and AI-safe summaries.
