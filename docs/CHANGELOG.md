# Changelog

All notable changes to this app should be documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added coverage-driven documentation reconciliation notes across architecture,
  requirements, tasks and package docs, including explicit warnings for
  photonic enum/code conflicts, webhook canonical contracts, Tri/Decision v0.2
  shape, secret unwrap semantics and network protocol naming.

- Added the Runtime Context (Not Superglobals) Knowledge Base concept, defining
  `Runtime.Context` as the runtime-owned, read-controlled execution context that
  replaces PHP-style superglobals, with session and shared mutable state in
  governed vaults rather than global bags.

- Added the Runtime Policy Config Knowledge Base concept and requirements,
  defining a system-level configuration loaded early in the request/boot lifecycle
  (`boot/main -> Runtime Policy Config -> Package Resolver -> Governance Checks -> Governed IR -> Runtime Execution`)
  to define default environment constraints, security limits, budgets, package registry rules,
  cache rules, allowed compute targets, and AI/tool permissions, while ensuring that local
  permissions cannot exceed or override global runtime policy.
- Added the Certified Package Registry Knowledge Base concept, defining a
  governed package source for signed, versioned, capability-declared,
  policy-rated packages; registry certification levels; lockfile evidence; and
  the rule that installed/certified packages are not unrestricted authority.
- Added the Package Resolver Knowledge Base concept, defining governed package
  and module resolution before execution, with identity/version/lockfile/hash
  /signature/registry/capability/effect checks, Governed IR linking, Authority
  Control for dynamic loading and provenance reports.
- Added the Context Tagged Verified Execution Cache Knowledge Base concept,
  defining context-tagged verified plan reuse, specialist parser/IR/policy/view
  /vault/compute/schedule/audit caches, strict invalidation and the rule that
  caches remember verified work but never grant authority.
- Added the AI Understandable Architecture Policy Knowledge Base concept,
  defining Galerina docs as a knowledge map with stable concept names,
  machine-readable indexes, component responsibility metadata, ADR/decision
  expectations and canonical examples so AI tools can read architecture without
  guessing.
- Added the Security Invariants And Policy Proof Knowledge Base concept,
  defining security-aware IR, mandatory classification, immutable execution
  plans, no ambient authority, policy/business-logic separation, capability
  tokens, visible unsafe blocks, mandatory audit, signed packages, hardened mode
  and policy-proof reporting.
- Added the Trust Conversion And Data Safety Knowledge Base concept, defining
  `safe`/`unsafe` value trust, inert unsafe values, approved
  `validate`/`guard`/`sanitize` conversion, safe-only contextual `encode.*`
  output and typed query interpolation denial.
- Added the Standard View Behaviour Knowledge Base concept, defining that common
  view exposure rules such as private owner-only exposure should be declared
  once in the runtime standard and inherited by permission references, with
  widening requiring explicit policy review and reports.
- Added the Built-In View Levels Knowledge Base concept, defining `public`,
  `internal`, `private`, `confidential`, `secret`, `restricted` and
  `regulated` as standard runtime/language view levels under `Runtime.View`.
- Added the Multi-Actor Audit Events Knowledge Base concept, defining how audit
  events should represent affected, delegated, source, system and AI actors
  while preserving runtime-owned `primary_actor` attribution.
- Added the Audit Actor Model Knowledge Base concept, defining automatic runtime
  actor attribution for audit events, permission-based audit emission,
  runtime-owned primary actor identity, multiple actor roles, manual metadata
  limits and spoofing warnings.
- Added the Field Read Rules Knowledge Base concept, documenting explicit field
  allow lists as the safest database read syntax and defining
  `fields: all except [...]` plus safer `fields: all current except [...]` as
  visible broad-read modes requiring warnings, resolved field reports and
  future-field leakage controls.
- Added the Secure By Default Syntax Principles Knowledge Base concept,
  documenting deny-by-default permissions, explicit risky-action authority,
  input contracts, output views, ownership checks, typed database access,
  target-aware encoding, secret-safe syntax, resource budgets, audit
  declarations, governed context and denied unsafe defaults as syntax/logic
  principles rather than only runtime checks.
- Added the Explicit Mutation And Vault Writes Knowledge Base concept,
  clarifying that local and vault state changes must be visibly marked with
  `mut`, that `mut foo++` is preferred over `foo++`, and that
  `mut secure.session[key] = value` is the preferred v0.1 source form over
  direct `SessionVault.write(context, ...)` calls.
- Added the Preplanned Startup And Fast Response Knowledge Base concept,
  connecting verified boot profiles, deterministic boot snapshot bundles,
  phased warmup, safe startup caches, precompiled app-kernel decisions,
  keep-alive transport policy, outbound connection pooling and network
  performance reports.
- Added the Variable Mutation Vault Design Knowledge Base concept, defining
  `let`, explicit `mut`, `readonly`, `vault`, `secure` and `Secret<T>` as the
  v0.1 direction while deferring `const` until a distinct compile-time constant
  need exists.
- Added the Data Visibility View Terminology Knowledge Base concept, defining
  `view` as the preferred field-level data exposure term and documenting the
  transition from `classify: public` to `view: public` for model fields and
  permission exposure rules.
- Added Runtime Terminology Evolution and Terminology And Naming Philosophy
  Knowledge Base concepts, defining Galerina as a governed compute orchestration
  platform and standardizing responsibility-based runtime terminology such as
  Runtime Command, Authority Control, Runtime Logistics, Resource Deployment
  Balancer, Execution Coordination Scheduler and Result Assembler.
- Added the Compute Balancer Knowledge Base concept, defining approved-only
  hardware target selection based on CPU/GPU/NPU/TPU/VPU/ASIC/FPGA
  availability, memory/VRAM pressure, thermal pressure, queue depth, power
  state, device trust and safe fallback.
- Rewrote the root and `galerina-core` README introductions to describe Galerina
  as a governance-first programming language, runtime and execution
  architecture for secure heterogeneous compute orchestration, including the
  development/use selling point of intent-driven governed execution plans and
  audit proof.
- Added the Governed Execution Director Knowledge Base concept and
  requirements defining a runtime planning layer that identifies data, checks
  contracts and policy, builds verified execution plans, selects compute and
  memory paths, uses passive modules, supports justified execution and records
  audit proof without becoming hidden authority.
- Added the Compile-Time Metadata Reflection Knowledge Base concept and
  requirements defining Galerina reflection as compile-time metadata for proof,
  tooling, audit mapping, schema/test generation, AI indexing and Governed IR
  creation, while denying runtime object inspection, string-based invocation
  and dynamic behaviour or permission mutation.
- Added the Memory Pressure Security Knowledge Base concept and requirements
  for treating low memory as a security event, including explicit memory
  budgets, fallible allocation, backpressure before out-of-memory,
  request/worker isolation, priority-based load shedding, deterministic
  cleanup and secret-safe OOM reports.
- Added Untrusted File And Asset Processing and Bit Width And Base64 Asset
  Policy Knowledge Base concepts, defining uploaded files, embedded assets and
  base64 data as untrusted executable-adjacent content requiring quarantine,
  isolated parsing, sanitisation, no active content by default, explicit
  numeric boundary checks and reportable memory/security policy decisions.
- Added the AI As Untrusted Reasoning Worker Knowledge Base concept and
  requirements for typed AI tasks, evidence-backed claims, sandboxed ML
  workers, explicit tool permissions, anti-hallucination reports and runtime
  enforcement that prevents AI output from becoming authority by default.
- Added the Generative Runtime Mapper Knowledge Base concept and planning
  requirements for an observational, AI-readable runtime/code/security mapper
  that can produce facts, heat maps, optimisation opportunities and reviewed
  suggestions without silently mutating runtime state or source code.

  pattern and local low-bit AI review Knowledge Base concepts, clarifying how
  Galerina can simplify syntax without weakening internal safety checks.

  identity statement for security-first, auditable, AI-readable and governed
  execution.

  practical Galerina web/API execution runs through Node.js while the core remains
  target-independent for future VM, WASM and native runtime work.
- Clarified the capability model as boundary-wide actor/package/flow/tool
  authority separate from code effects, including capability boundary checks,
  grant rules and report targets.
- Added MCP AI Tool Boundaries documentation, including the Knowledge Base
  concept, framework boundary guidance, MCP report targets, token-boundary
  rules, no generic vault access and requirements that MCP tools, resources and
  prompts go through typed, permissioned, audited Galerina boundaries.
- Added Quantum Readiness documentation covering post-quantum crypto policy,
  crypto inventory reports, `Random` versus `SecureRandom`, isolated quantum
  types, measurement-before-flow rules and future quantum target planning.
- Added typed contract implementations and tests for core package completion:
  `galerina-core-network` now has policy, TLS, endpoint, backend-selection and
  report contracts; `galerina-core-runtime` has context, result, effect-decision
  and report helpers; `galerina-core-vector` has vector/matrix/tensor validation

  tested or reportable.
- Added developer ergonomics and security lessons to the Galerina runtime
  capability roadmap, requirements and core roadmap tasks.
- Added a first-class monkey-patching ban for normal Galerina code, with adapter,
  interface/protocol, pipeline, test-mock and signed-hotfix alternatives.
- Clarified Galerina's first product direction as secure web runtime code, while
  keeping low-level systems targets, embedded targets and native executable
  output as later target paths.
- Documented Galerina's systems direction: portable systems output and native ABI
  work are future generated backend/interop targets, while normal Galerina source
  remains high-level, strict, source-mapped, permissioned and reportable.
- Set `galerina serve` / secure web runtime as the main v1 milestone, with a
  simple portable build target as secondary v1 work and native executable output
  as future target planning.

  `docs/reports` and `docs/rules`, plus a Knowledge Base concept note for the
  documentation layer model.
- Added Priority Categories docs to classify Galerina ideas as non-negotiable
  rules, core language rules, core concepts, platform concepts, recommended
  design rules or future/research concepts before implementation.
- Added Encapsulation Model docs defining Galerina encapsulation as controlled
  data movement through secure flows, classification, response contracts,
  capabilities, effects, scoped lifetimes, package exports, safe mutation and
  reports instead of public/private visibility alone.
- Added Model Security Contracts docs defining models as classified internal
  data contracts with explicit relationships, mutation rules, storage
  separation, model report targets and AI-readable summaries.
- Added Knowledge Base concept docs for the core `data -> flow -> permission ->
  boundary -> report` model, permission/capability/actor semantics, scoped

  mental-model entries for events, repositories/storage and adapters/connectors.
- Added Polymorphism concept docs covering contract-based polymorphism,
  adapter-based polymorphism, union/match variants, constrained generics,
  permission-aware implementation selection and effective reports.
- Added No Inheritance And Explicit Security docs making inheritance and
  inherited authority disallowed in normal Galerina source, with composition,
  contracts, adapters, explicit views, explicit permissions, secure flows and
  effective reports as replacements.

  explicit fallback branch for `match`, including webhook and security-sensitive
  handling rules.
- Added Securely Governed Runtime, AI Compute Plan and Verified Fast Paths
  Knowledge Base concepts, plus runtime package guidance and TODOs for governed
  execution plans, AI compute hooks and fast path signatures.
- Added AI Self-Modification Governance concept covering AI-generated code
  quarantine, capability leases, attenuation, approval gates, immutable AI audit
  logs and the rule that AI may request but not self-grant authority.
- Added Deny By Default Risk Features concept covering eval, shell, hidden
  network/filesystem access, globals, unsafe interop, raw pointers, monkey
  patching, policy-bypassing reflection, AI self-grants and complexity features

- Expanded `docs/OPTICAL_IO.md` with Galerina Optical I/O Layer positioning:
  optical I/O as topology-aware, encrypted, typed data movement for AI clusters,
  accelerator links, memory pooling, fallback reports and future benchmarks,
  not raw light control or photonic compute.
- Expanded Galerina safe-networking policy to clarify that packets cannot be made
  invisible, while packet contents should be encrypted, authenticated,

  for business applications, including domain/flow/infrastructure/policy
  boundaries, pure-domain defaults, architecture reports and warnings against
  heavyweight layer-first DDD.

- Added `docs/NEURAL_ACCELERATOR_PACKAGES.md` to document neural,
  neuromorphic, low-bit, AI accelerator and photonic package boundaries.
- Expanded `galerina-core-vector` with matrix, tensor, shape and numeric element contract
  placeholders.
- Added `packages-galerina/galerina-ai-agent/` for supervised AI agent, tool permission, task
  group, merge policy and report contracts.

  flows, retries, quarantine, checkpoints, memory/system failure policy and
  partial success reporting.
- Added `galerina-core-reports` processing report contracts for resilient/batch flows.
- Added `packages-galerina/galerina-tools-benchmark/` for Galerina benchmark and diagnostics contracts,
  including light/full modes, target fallback checks, privacy-safe reports and
  optional future sharing payloads.
- Added a placeholder `Galerina benchmark` CLI command entry for the future benchmark
  runner.
- Added `docs/GALERINA_FINANCIAL_MARKETS.md` covering Galerina-centered financial
  market contracts, runtime direction, safety rules and adapter boundaries.
- Added `docs/OPTICAL_IO.md` documenting `optical_io` as a high-speed
  interconnect/data-movement target for Intel Silicon Photonics and OCI-style
  systems, distinct from photonic compute.
- Added `docs/AI_ACCELERATOR_TARGETS.md` documenting passive AI accelerator
  target profiles, with Intel Gaudi 3 represented as a backend profile rather
  than Galerina syntax.
- Added Galerina Structured Await documentation across core language, runtime,
  app-kernel and workspace docs, covering `await all`, `await race`, scoped
  cancellation, mandatory timeout policy, stream backpressure, queue handoff and
  async/concurrency reports.
- Added typed async/concurrency report contracts to `galerina-core-reports`.
- Added conservative storage-aware performance documentation covering SSD/NVMe/M.2
  wording, unknown-storage fallback, incremental build/IDE index planning,
  streaming large files, read-only mapping, cache bypass and cache safety rules.
- Added typed storage and build-cache report contracts to `galerina-core-reports`.
- Added production boot/profile rules that default-disable benchmark and
  development-only packages such as `galerina-tools-benchmark` and `galerina-devtools-*`,
  with explicit reported production package overrides required when policy
  allows them.
- Added `docs/ELECTRICAL_INFRASTRUCTURE.md`, `packages-galerina/galerina-electrical-core/`
  and `packages-galerina/galerina-ot-core/` for electrical infrastructure and
  operational-technology package planning, with explicit safety boundaries
  against replacing certified protection equipment, PLC safety systems, SCADA
  products or qualified electrical engineering judgement.
- Added an explicit v1 surface freeze around core syntax, core type-system
  semantics, the memory-safety model, CPU target support and WASM target support.
- Added `docs/CORE_FOUNDATION_ROADMAP.md` to sequence foundation work before
  package, domain or advanced-target expansion.

### Changed

- Renamed the generic `packages-galerina/app/` folder to
  `packages-galerina/galerina-framework-example-app/` so the package collection does not contain an
  ambiguous `app` package name.
- Updated workspace documentation and configuration to use `packages-galerina/galerina-core/`
  for the Galerina language package.
- Renamed the legacy language install script to `install-Galerina.sh`.
- Clarified that Galerina core is the language/compiler layer, while the Secure App
  Kernel is the optional runtime layer and full frameworks remain separate.
- Clarified that `galerina-framework-api-server` serves HTTP and delegates validation, auth and
  typed execution to `galerina-framework-app-kernel`.
- Documented the future split-repository layout where `packages-galerina/` can become
  its own reusable Git repository imported by multiple frameworks.
- Added simple `console.log("...")` output support to Galerina core checked Run Mode.
- Expanded `galerina-core-compute` target selection contracts with `low_bit_ai`,
  `cpu.generic`, AI inference workload planning and compute-auto selection
  reporting.
- Clarified that BitNet ternary model weights are separate from Galerina `Tri`
  semantics.
- Reworked low-bit AI target naming so Galerina source uses generic `low_bit_ai` and
  `ternary_ai` targets instead of backend-specific BitNet syntax.
- Completed initial `galerina-ai`, `galerina-ai-lowbit`, `galerina-target-cpu` and
  `galerina-cpu-kernels` contracts with validation helpers, examples and tests.
- Completed initial `galerina-core-compute` offload planning reports, low-bit AI fallback
  example and test coverage.
- Added a placeholder `Galerina graph` CLI command entry for future project graph
  generation and querying.
- Implemented the initial `Galerina graph` command to generate project graph JSON and
  a Markdown graph report from `galerina.workspace.json`.
- Clarified that project graph syntax and CLI commands are backend-neutral, with
  Graphify treated as an optional swappable backend rather than Galerina syntax.
- Expanded `galerina-devtools-project-graph` with a galerina-native workspace scanner that maps
  packages, documents, exported TypeScript contracts, package references and
  generated graph report outputs.
- Added graph query, explain and path helpers to `galerina-devtools-project-graph` and exposed
  them through `Galerina graph query`, `Galerina graph explain` and `Galerina graph path`.
- Updated workspace package mapping so `galerina-tools-benchmark` is tracked by the project
  graph and package registry.
- Added `optical_io` to compute, benchmark and photonic target planning
  contracts as an interconnect-aware data movement target.
- Added generic `ai_accelerator` planning support and an Intel Gaudi 3 backend
  profile to AI accelerator, compute and benchmark contracts.
- Narrowed the active workspace target list to `cpu` and `wasm`, with GPU, AI
  accelerator, photonic, optical I/O, low-bit AI and other advanced target work
  labelled post-v1 unless needed by core type-system semantics.
- Clarified that Galerina must not make measured speed claims until the compiler,
  memory model, runtime and benchmark methodology exist.
- Defined AI-readable as concrete syntax/tooling properties: regular grammar,
  explicit effects/imports, typed errors, source maps, stable diagnostics and
  machine-readable reports.

### Removed

- Removed stale generated-output-only duplicate package folders
  `packages-galerina/galerina-cli/`, `packages-galerina/galerina-compute/` and
  `packages-galerina/galerina-config/` after confirming the canonical `galerina-core-*` packages
  contain the current source, tests, manifests and newer contracts.
- Moved `packages-galerina/galerina-finance-core/`, `packages-galerina/galerina-electrical-core/` and
  `packages-galerina/galerina-ot-core/` to `C:\laragon\www\Galerina_Archive\packages-galerina\` and
  removed them from active workspace package resolution.

### Fixed

- Nothing yet.
