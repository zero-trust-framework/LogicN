# R&D corpus closure + shipping-readiness ledger (2026-06-18)

## ▶ RESUME POINTER — 2026-06-19 session close v2 (read FIRST after a /clear)
**▶ NEXT (owner directive): work on the CORE ROADMAP** (`logicn-build-roadmap.md` — the language/compiler
roadmap). The structured-engineering + social-ecosystem threads below are DONE/R&D-filed; the owner wants the
core roadmap next.

**State at clear (everything committed local `main`, NOT pushed — #149):** SOT `--core` **3702 green · 0 fail**;
graph 3676/4069; both LogicN + LogicN-R-AND-D git trees CLEAN.

**Shipped this session (the big arcs):**
- **DbC output post-conditions (0040)** — `invariant { ensure result … }` fail-closed on EVERY tier (`fa9fae5`
  + gap-fix `d9316c2` + WASM single-exit `71ec537`). The done-record's "fail-OPEN" was REFUTED (a fail-SAFE
  capability gap); follow-up = early-return `br` rewrite + Z3 discharge (0024 track).
- **AOT #1 const-fold (`dc76ed4`) + AOT #2 branch-fold/DCE (`056ac70`).** Next = AOT #3 trap-tail simplify.
- **Structured-engineering metadata (R&D 0045) — Phases 1-3 SHIPPED:** `//lln:` generated-comment tier
  (`1804557`); `LLN-HW-004` hardware uncertainty (`5d8d611`); **`logicn deps [--write]`** = `//lln: USES/
  USEDBY/IMPACT/COMPLEXITY` (`1a57761`/`45bc0a5`/`2fb7ac1`); `contract.architecture{}` + `LLN-ARCH-001`
  (`c04fac0`) + Stable-Deps `LLN-ARCH-002` always-hard-error (`f8468a4`); token renamed `//@`→`//lln:`
  (`b2b1c6e`, owner-final, no `@generated`). **+ `0bbf39f`:** `logicn deps --all [dir] [--write]` whole-app
  refresh via a NEW cross-file analyzer `analyzeProgramFlowDependencies` (USES/USEDBY/IMPACT span files —
  closes the per-file "safe to delete" fail-open); `logicn build --package` auto-refreshes `//lln:` by default
  (`--no-refresh` opts out, single-file build stays pure); `lln` short bin alias. Remaining: 2c/3d volatility
  (0045 proved the churn+depth formula), 3a per-flow graph edges, Phase 4 polish. See [[logicn-structured-engineering-metadata]].
- **git/build hygiene:** untracked ~501 ephemeral `build/*` artifacts + the 2.1MB `build/graph/*.json`/html
  (gitignored; kept the small nav `.md`s). `build/` now tracks 4 intentional files.

**R&D queue 0036–0052 filed.** Worker closed 0045–0049 (done-records committed; 0045 re-grounded to
owner decisions `215aab0`). NEW filed this session for the worker: **0047** (marker→keep `//lln:`, DONE),
**0048** (testing strategy — top adds = wire 0014 fuzz live + 0016 contract-test generator), **0049** (USES/
USEDBY runtime → incremental recompute = real win), **0050** (cloud-native blind-observability telemetry
sidecar — build the exporter, state already exists), **0051** (ecosystem-language positioning + verified
imports — mostly already-true, don't change the language), **0052** (WASM compilation granularity —
single vs multi-module, packages-outside; verified current = one signed `.wasm`/package + fuse, component-model
#102–104 reserved; landscape question, no maths yet). See [[logicn-social-ecosystem-cloud-native]].

**▶ 0050 + 0051 + 0052 ALL DONE + HUB-ABSORBED 2026-06-19** (worker done-records committed in R&D repo; hub KB
docs written). **0050** (`logicn-blind-observability-exporter.md`) — SOUND-WITH-FIXES, bench 42/42; the
governance-native metrics are the unique value (generic RED/503 deferred to the mesh); backpressure governance_deny
arm is NET-NEW kernel→runtime bridge wiring; egress fence (never export `AuditEvent.path`). **NAMING — OWNER DECISION
2026-06-20: `logicn-governance-telemetry`** (panel recommended `-exporter`; owner kept "telemetry" + added "governance";
"sidecar" dropped from the name).
**0051** (`logicn-ecosystem-positioning-verified-imports.md`) — positioning-not-language-change, bench 13/13;
verified-import HYBRID = prod/mesh signed-hash + dev file-path, profile DERIVED from `SecurityPosture`, NO lockfile
(emit untrusted `import-closure.json`). **0052** (`logicn-wasm-compilation-granularity.md`) — default AOT-fuse +
opt-in multi-module/component mode; ship interim host-linker over `capabilityRegistry` FIRST, don't block on
#102–104; bench 15/15. **0052's worker artifacts (wasm-granularity/) committed by the worker; R&D tree clean.**

**▶ OWNER DECISIONS 2026-06-20:** (1) 0050 name = **`logicn-governance-telemetry`** (panel rec'd `-exporter`; owner
kept "telemetry"). (2) Next build = **0052 multi-module Phase A → COMPLETE** (`68879a4`+`f40c945`+`f4fa7b1`+`ee8eb7d`): **Slice 1**
`fuse-loader.ts` `fusePackages` + pure `planComposition` [SET-SIGNED, deny-by-default, acyclic, unambiguous] +
`makeProviderFactory` (unconsumed `provides`=inert seam); **Slice 2** REAL producer→consumer wasm→wasm call proven via
committed `tests/fixtures/compose/` (consumer.main→42 through provider; differential control consumer-alone→0;
order-independent) + the fixtures-dist gitignore-negation so a fresh checkout passes; **CLI** `logicn fuse <dirs>
[--invoke pkg:export]`. app-kernel **54/54**, SOT **3705**. **Phase B** (Component Model isolation for UNTRUSTED peers)
= externally blocked on #102–104; **Phase C** (app-split) = speculative; §7 perf bench deferred ("no maths yet").
**OWNER 2026-06-20: build BOTH (0050 then 0051).** **0050 exporter Slice 1 SHIPPED** — new package
`@logicn/governance-telemetry` (`renderPrometheus` + closed egress fence [unsafe labels dropped+counted, effects→family,
closed vocab] + `startExporter` read-only /metrics /healthz /readyz; +14 tests). DEFERRED: host snapshot adapter, OTLP,
the `503 + X-LogicN-State` backpressure bridge (kernel→runtime, security-sensitive). **0051 SHIPPED** —
`deriveImportProfile` (core-config: posture `on`⇒require-signature, `off`⇒file-path, fail-secure) + `requireSignature`
enforcement in `fuse-loader` (overrides `allowUnsigned` fail-secure, both single + set) + `buildImportClosure` (untrusted
`import-closure.json`, `trusted:false`). +7 tests; app-kernel 57/57, core-config 12/12, SOT 3705. **Both owner-gated
builds (0050 Slice 1 + 0051) DONE.** Open follow-ups: 0050 host snapshot adapter + OTLP + backpressure bridge; 0051 end-to-end host wiring.

**▶ AOT #2 — branch-folding + dead-arm DCE — ✅ SHIPPED `056ac70`** (`foldToBool` folds a const `if`
condition → emit only the taken arm; dead arm + locals dropped; nested=true → explicit returns valid
anywhere; fidelity byte-identical interp≡WASM; +6 tests). **▶ Immediate next:** AOT #3 trap-tail simplify ·
#4 small-pure-flow inlining · #5 cross-flow LTO · #6 PGO (defer). Build order from 0036.
**0040 WASM single-exit — ✅ SHIPPED `71ec537`** (owner-authorised): straight-line post-condition flows now
enforce on WASM (capture tail → `$logicn_result` → gate → trap on violation; WASM≡interp); nested/early-return
flows still decline to the interpreter (early-return `br` rewrite = remaining follow-up). Z3 discharge of
decidable bounds = the 0024 python track (not yet production-wired). **Governance decision-path wiring
(0025/0035) — concrete blocker IDENTIFIED:** the semantic reference tier IS decided (**WASM i32**, owner
2026-06-18 — NOT open). But `decideFlowVPP`/`decideAtBoundary`/the VPP fold live ONLY in `logicn-tower-citizen`,
NOT in the core-compiler effect-checker (no `bfsReachable` there either). So "wiring" = a **cross-package
architectural port** (tower-citizen VPP fold → compiler governance) that is **security-critical** and gated on
the **0014 differential wired into the live tiers** first. Needs deliberate design — do NOT rush it. The
next safe step toward it = solidify the 0014 fidelity differential as a permanent live-tier gate. **0037 presence-channel:** NO PRODUCTION TARGET (confirmed by source —
`interpreter.ts:1302` / `parser.ts:4916`): the SHIPPED `for…where` is the GUARD form ("run the body only
for items where the guard is truthy"), which never overloads trit-0 as a mask. The trit-0=INDETERMINATE
aliasing hazard exists only in the R&D *tensor-mask* form, which was never shipped — so the shipped form
already avoids it. Nothing to build unless/until the tensor-mask form is added (it would need the separate
presence bit then).
Also queued (owner-steer via AskUserQuestion per the new "owner-gated = ask" rule): 0037 separate-presence
channel · 0031-34B route auto-taint · 0025/0035 governance decision-path wiring · the "Mesh" rename · 0040
follow-ups (WASM single-exit `$logicn_result` lowering · Z3 discharge of decidable post-condition bounds).

**R&D worker queue 0036–0044 — ALL DONE + ABSORBED (2026-06-19).** 0036/0037/0038/0039/0041 absorbed earlier
(`4c2013c`); **0040/0042/0043/0044 absorbed this pass** (see the cont-section below). **0040 was BUILT**
(owner: "ideas was re-R&D, get it done" — it is NOT owner-gated). POST-CLEAR TODO ✅ DONE. Do NOT edit the
worker's tree.

**Owner-gated PRODUCTION builds awaiting a steer:** 0037 separate-presence-channel (correctness, "do first")
· 0038 throw-at-op refactor (cleaner than the shipped value-propagation fix) · 0039 benchmark re-author
(spec ready: matrix n=32 all / tri-logic runBulkTri(100000) / data-query N=2000) · 0031-34B route auto-taint
(breaking, strict-profile) · 0025/0035 governance decision-path wiring · `move`/`USE_AFTER_MOVE` syntax ·
WASM handles/WasmGC · the **"Mesh" → ? rename** (owner picks the name; TritMesh/TritMeshQL/MeshQL + `meshql.mjs`).

## R&D 0036–0043 AT A GLANCE (the latest worker batch)

| # | Investigated | Machine-proven verdict (kernel) | Hub action / status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0036** | which classical AOT tricks LogicN should adopt; the tower-citizen tensor-precompute pitch | const-fold + propagation + branch-fold + DCE = the real adoptable set (**1.64× wall-clock, 7.1× code-size**, byte-identical 50k inputs); tensor-precompute is the classic precompute trade **NOT O(1)** (apply O(N²); fusion densifies 40.9×; ntt_mul≠matmul) | **BUILT** → AOT #1 const-fold (`dc76ed4`) + AOT #2 branch-fold/DCE (`056ac70`); next AOT #3–6 |
| **0037** | for/where branchless filter; trit-0-as-mask correctness | filter is **MODEST** (~1.0×); the real win is a CORRECTNESS fix — trit-0 aliases 0=INDETERMINATE → needs a separate presence channel | **`for…where` GUARD form SHIPPED** (`2c27e14`); presence-channel = **no production target** (guard form already avoids the aliasing) |
| **0038** | a checked i32 trap assigned to a non-returned binding silently discarded | CONFIRMED **fail-OPEN** (11/11), tree+sync tiers; fix-spec = trap-at-op | **FIXED in production** (`3596fb5`+`490c492`); R&D detector flips RED = fix present; throw-at-op = recommended cleanup |
| **0039** | make the 3 excluded benchmarks comparable (matrix-multiply / tri-logic / data-query) | one unit per runtime (mul-adds/s n=32 · trit-ops/s · record-scans/s); **no nbody-class false win** | **Spec ready**; production re-author owner-gated (LLN-MANIFEST-TAMPER blocks in-place `.lln`) |
| **0040** | output post-conditions (`ensure result …`) + Z3 discharge | the "fail-OPEN" was **REFUTED** (a fail-SAFE compile-reject **capability gap**); single-exit fail-closed gate + Z3 discharge design | **BUILT** → output post-conditions fail-closed across every tier (`fa9fae5` + gap-fix `d9316c2`); WASM single-exit + Z3 = follow-ups |
| **0041** | sub-expression memoization + content-addressed store | same **amortize envelope** as 0036: 5.27× on repeated/pure, **1.77× SLOWER** on unique; whole-flow LRU already captures most | **DON'T-build-by-default**; the shipped LRU suffices |
| **0042** | governance over WDM wavelength channels (tri-photonic) | **vocabulary over the proven governance-as-T-MAC fold** (per-channel = `decideAtBoundary`; bank = `allOf`+K3 annihilator, exhaustive 1092 + 200k banks 0 violations); genuine new bit = `.tmf`-category→wavelength-lane partition | **OWNER-AUTHORISED for future photonic compatibility** (2026-06-19) — forward-compat design; projected photonic envelopes now allowed (lenient perf rule) |
| **0043** | KEEP/REVISE/RETIRE re-audit of every standing owner decision | the spine is proven green TODAY vs the shipped binary; keep it, revise the wiring, retire substrate-magic; **fail-closed-core-LAST** sequencing | **Design audit (steer map)**; hub reconciled stale rows (M4 kemdem fixed / tmx256+container not; M3 gen-tag present; C3 Ed25519-only) |

**Net:** of 0036–0043, **only 0036 (AOT) + 0040 (DbC) were buildable production changes — both now BUILT.** 0038 was already fixed; 0037/0041 = no-build verdicts; 0039 = owner-gated spec; 0042 = owner-authorised future-compat; 0043 = the steer map.

## BENCHMARK SNAPSHOT 2026-06-19 (full suite, i9-9900K / Node v24.16.0 — post 0040+AOT#2)
Full `runner.mjs` + `compare.mjs`. **Honest scoreboard (LRU cache-hit "LogicN passive" wins EXCLUDED as
artifacts — the compare flags them ⚠️cache + names the real first-call winner).** Real-compute ranking:
- **🥇 Rust (generic / AVX2)** — the compute ceiling: wins arithmetic-threshold (1.56B/s), six-digit-guess,
  record-allocation, collection-pipeline (13B/s), governance-cost (889M/s), low-memory (6.1B/s), gpu-compute,
  mandelbrot, spectral-norm, tmf-container (~10 numeric benchmarks).
- **🥈 Node.js (V8 JIT)** — wins the string/branchy/framework lane: compute-mix (134M/s first-call),
  call-chain (317M/s), nbody (123M/s), json-parse (3.52M/s), binary-trees (79.9M/s), framework-pipeline (=the
  LogicN App Kernel, 408K/s).
- **🥉 LogicN WASM ▶ production** — LogicN's REAL native-speed path: WINS fibonacci-recursive (16.5K/s) +
  hardware-targets (46.5M/s); podiums six-digit (38.7M/s 🥉) + governance-cost (3.12M/s 🥉). This is the
  realistic LogicN ceiling (≈native-CPU class) — the target per [[logicn-aot-tricks-verdict]].
- **LogicN interp (governed/manifest)** = the FLOOR (Stage-A TS tree-walker): beats Python on only **1/11**
  unit-aligned benchmarks; wins crypto-ops/text-html only because no native column exists there.
- **3 benchmarks EXCLUDED — not unit-aligned** (matrix-multiply / tri-logic / data-query) = 0039's spec, still
  owner-gated to re-author. Takeaway unchanged: governed interpreter = correctness floor; **WASM is the speed
  story**; overflow workloads fail closed (Fork-A/0038). My session's 0040+AOT#2 are codegen/runtime-correctness,
  not interpreter-throughput, changes — perf-neutral on the interp benchmark path by construction.

**Gate (this pass):** SOT `--core` **3659 green · 0 fail**; graph **3667 nodes / 4061 edges / 1952 files** clean;
0014 fidelity 4/4; tsc clean across the touched packages.

## Proven ledger (re-runnable artifact behind each)
| Task | Verdict / proof |
|---|---|
| 0024 Z3/SMT i32 conformance | z3-solver 4.16.0: **18/20 obligations PROVEN domain-complete**; 2 div/rem value identities EXCLUDED (BV-division solver limit; definitional + 3M-sample-backed). The note-40 "math compiler" — now a real proof. |
| 0025 governance-as-T-MAC | decision-identical to the per-node fold; one VPP min-reduction; fail-closed. |
| 0027 decouple governance | verdict trit-vector, one VPP pass, decision-identical to interleaved, fail-closed. |
| 0028 photonic HW-readiness | SNR-aware CALIBRATION-REQUIRED gate; harness caught an over-strong invariant → EXCLUDED-until-HW. |
| 0029 linear-flatten | exact; two-sided crossover mapped; ternary-lossy (ANN regime only). |
| 0030 flat AST + const-time | **2.22× flat SoA AST**; constant-time = a security trade, not O(1). |
| 0031 boundary-flow | keyword REJECTED; param-trusted-by-default fail-OPEN reproduced; fix = `tainted` param (34A/34B). |
| 0032 stability-vs-C++ | per-axis (not blanket); the 2 liveness hazards reproduced — **now FIXED (see below)**. |
| 0033 WASM memory-safety | 32/32; intra-module corruption + ternary tombstoning + crypto-hygiene gaps. |
| 0034 memory-safety stance | drop the borrow checker for value-state + ternary-tag; Claim A/B proven vs shipped binary. |
| 0035 path-auth + mtrit mask | 1092 paths fail-closed/non-leaky; mask works; strictly finer than binary BFS. |

Citation verifiers exit 0 (the content-assert caught + fixed a real mis-cite in the 0031 done-report).

## APPLY PHASE 2026-06-19 (owner Go) — what SHIPPED + what's still parked
**Shipped this phase (commits on `main`, not pushed):**
- **0032 liveness** — `a728e44` (loops+recursion fail-closed) + `a9c4ebd` (wall-clock `checkDeadline()` in loop bodies + enforcer/capabilityHost propagated into sub-interpreters) + **`264723a`** (the part the first pass MISSED: the duplicate `whileStmt` in the *synchronous* pure-flow fast-path `tryPureFlowSync` — it had no iteration cap and swallowed every non-`SyncReturn` throw, so after Fork-A=TRAP an int-overflow→runtimeError→thrown-SyncNotSupported aborted the loop body before the counter advanced → **infinite loop**; this is what hung the compute-mix benchmark ~31 min. Fix = stop swallowing (bail → trapping tree-walker) + cap the sync loop; +4 regression tests).
- **0033** — `5c1f846` (crypto hygiene: `timingSafeEqual` + `fill(0)` derived keys in `logicn-ext-tmf/kemdem.ts`) + `692e62d` (`static-memory-pool` per-allocation **generation tag** → `LSM-UAF-001` use-after-free guard, +2 tests).
- **0034** — `08d6905` (borrow-checker KB → non-goal banner on 3 docs).
- **#128(b)/GAP-4** — `c6c2896` (forEachStmt → real WASM counted loop over the host array bridge; was a fail-closed `unreachable` trap. Executes + interpreter-fidelity tested. **Item 4 clear deliverable.**)
- **0031 / Phase-34A** — `0ccdc80` (the `tainted` PARAMETER qualifier: opt-in, marks the param `unsafe`, reuses LLN-VALUESTATE-003/004/005 → closes the param-trusted-by-default fail-OPEN. Non-breaking — bare params unchanged. 34B route-handler auto-taint, the breaking strict-gated half, stays parked.)
- **`for…where` filtered iteration** — `2c27e14` (`where` promoted to active keyword; guard form, interp + WASM, fidelity-matched; the genuine for/where kernel, guard form — no K3 0-aliasing).
- **Global fail-closed-invariant guard** — `b403639` (a checked-op trap must fail the flow closed regardless of result placement; surfaced div0 also fails open when discarded) + **§7 benchmark scoreboard** (winner→slowest, ×vs both, ⚠️cache-flagged).
- **0038 FIXED** — `3596fb5` + `490c492` (the confirmed i32-overflow fail-OPEN: a checked trap assigned to / nested past a non-returned binding was silently discarded → flow completed with a wrong result, e.g. arithmetic-threshold int:63248 while WASM trapped. Fix: `isCheckedTrap` (IntegerOverflow/DivisionByZero) propagates out of binding/expr statements + through binary operands; soft runtimeErrors keep value semantics. arithmetic-threshold + compute-mix now fail closed fast (0–4ms, clean IntegerOverflow). R&D 0038 stays open for the worker: cross-tier verify + distinct trap tag + other hard-trap kinds. ⚠️ `full-suite-2026-06-19.json` PREDATES this — arithmetic-threshold now fails closed.)
- Verification: graph clean (3663/4057); SOT `--core` **3635** + compiler **3511/3511 (0 todo)** + sentinel **33**; 0014 fidelity 4/4; full 28-benchmark suite **lands**.

**Benchmark before/after (vs `full-suite-2026-06-16.json`) — HONEST attribution:** the deltas are NOT my fixes. My fixes add one int-compare per loop iteration + a no-op deadline check (no enforcer in the bench harness) and *remove* try/catches — perf-neutral by construction. The visible deltas are: (a) **Fork-A=TRAP** (2026-06-18, owner decision): overflow-dependent flows now correctly TRAP → compute-mix / matrix-multiply / data-query / tri-logic / call-chain governed = `—` (IntegerOverflow / excluded), and checked i32 arithmetic is slower than the old wrap (arithmetic-threshold −72%, governance-cost −74%); (b) **unit-normalisation fixes** since 06-16 (the absurd +900,000% swings on nodejs/passive rows = the old per-pass unit bug being corrected, not real perf); (c) **5 new benchmarks** (mandelbrot, spectral-norm, binary-trees, tmf-container, framework-pipeline). The 06-16 baseline is too stale (pre-Fork-A, pre-normalisation) to cleanly isolate my fixes; the real result is *the suite now completes and overflow workloads fail closed*.

**Found + filed + SHIPPED (`task_a680d348` → `c55659a`):** the bytecode VM (`runBytecode`) had NO loop cap → now traps at `maxIterations` via back-edge counting (byte-identical to the tree-walker; caveat: count is GLOBAL not per-loop — conservative, latent fidelity gap for a future >100k-back-edge multi-loop bytecode flow, per-loop refinement is the follow-up). `compileToBytecode` cache re-keyed flow-NAME-only → `WeakMap<AstNode,…>` (per-compilation isolation — also removes the bench-runner cross-`main` pollution). +5 tests; hub-verified (suite 3502 + benchmark probe). Implemented in a spawned session, verified + committed here.

**Still parked (owner-gated / not started):** 0034 `move`/`USE_AFTER_MOVE` wiring (new syntax — needs owner design); 0031 **34B** route-handler auto-taint (breaking — strict-profile-gated, needs routeDecl wiring); 0035 trit-fold reachability + 0025 governance-T-MAC decision path (security-critical governance decision path); 0033 WASM handles/WasmGC (ABI); GAP-2 (CLI: expose effectful `secure flow main` to `--invoke` — fuzzy, "document or expose"). **Item 4's clear half (GAP-4 forEach) + 0031-34A SHIPPED above.**

## WORKER R&D RESULTS 2026-06-19 (bridge 0036–0041 — worker session drained the queue; 0040 HELD)
The R&D worker ran the six tasks the hub filed this session. **0036/0037/0038/0039/0041 DONE** (done-reports
committed `5e7b9e4`/`158dc68`/`48e85fe`); **0040 HELD** (DbC/formal-verification — worker respected the owner
"do not run yet"). All re-ran the hub harnesses (don't-trust-check) + extended them; each self-corrected at
least once (recorded). Nothing built into production (owner-gated). Summaries:

- **0036 — AOT adoption.** Re-verified D1–D5 (none refuted) + independently re-derived D2/D4. NEW proof
  `aot-classical-tricks.mjs`: const-fold + propagation + branch-fold + DCE = **1.64× wall-clock, 7.1× fewer
  AST nodes, 2.1× fewer taken-path dispatches**, byte-identical over 50k random inputs. Source-verified that
  LogicN has literal-const substitution (`staticConsts`) but **NOT** const-*expression* folding or
  branch-folding → **ADOPT #1/#2**. Build order: ①const-expr-fold+prop ②branch-fold+dead-arm-DCE
  ③trap-tail simplify ④small-pure-flow inlining ⑤cross-flow LTO ⑥PGO(defer). (Self-correction: dead-arm
  DCE is a code-size/cache/lowering-speed win, NOT a per-call traversal win — a correct walker never walks
  the dead arm.)
- **0037 — trit graph-query engine** (⚠ "Mesh" rename pending; also flags `tri-encription/bench/meshql.mjs`).
  Confirmed for/where branchless filter is **MODEST** (≈1.0× ± noise; inverts for expensive f). **Proved the
  SEPARATE-PRESENCE-CHANNEL correctness fix end-to-end** (trit-0 as a filter mask aliases 0=INDETERMINATE → a
  fail-open/read bug; a distinct presence bit restores distinguishability + stays fail-closed) → **adoptable
  trick #1 (correctness, do first; cheap — one bit lane).** Dynamic-`where` = runtime mask over columnar
  layout, taken path (NOT superposition = 2–4× work). Precompute envelope MEASURED: WIN small+dense+repeated
  all-pairs; LOSE sparse/single-source/large; O(N²)/relationship memory.
- **0038 — i32 fail-open.** INDEPENDENTLY confirmed (11/11) + fix-spec'd. **Hub already shipped the fix**
  (`3596fb5`+`490c492`, value-propagation). Worker's recommended design is **cleaner**: make `i32R` THROW at
  the op (trap-at-point) — then a trap can never reach a downstream op or assignment, so the message
  divergence + the `isCheckedTrap` checks both become unnecessary, and all tiers align to the bare trap-kind.
  → **the throw-at-op refactor is the recommended follow-up** to my value-propagation fix.
- **0039 — benchmark alignment** (SPEC; production edit owner-gated). Unify matrix-multiply to **n=32 for ALL**
  (tree-walker cap; unit `mul-adds/s`, N=32768); tri-logic = every runtime `runBulkTri(100000)` (`trit-ops/s`);
  data-query = one query `filterAndCount` at **N=2000** (fix the `logicnOpsPerRun=1000` undercount). Model
  harness proves the unit logic + that it introduces no nbody-class false win. **Ready for the hub/owner to apply.**
- **0041 — memoization.** Win/loss envelope: **5.27× on repeated/pure**, **1.77× SLOWER + unbounded memory on
  unique**, cold = full price, content-addressed store 4.62× for hot static, pure-only/PII preserved (0 leaks).
  Verdict: **DON'T build by default** — the shipped whole-flow LRU already captures most of the win; the
  sub-expression tier earns its keep only for a profiled hot pure sub-result recurring across whole-flow args.

**Answer to "what R&D is on hold / unlockable":** **0040 (DbC + formal verification) is the only HELD R&D
task** — unlock by owner go (verify-before-build: ~80% likely already shipped). Everything else in the worker
queue is DONE. Owner-gated PRODUCTION builds (separate from R&D-worker tasks) still pending a steer: 0036
const-fold/DCE adoption (build order above), 0037 presence-channel + tricks, 0038 throw-at-op refactor, 0039
benchmark re-author (spec ready), 0031-34B, 0025/0035 governance decision-path, `move` syntax, WASM handles.

## WORKER R&D RESULTS 2026-06-19 (cont) — 0040 BUILT · 0042/0043/0044 absorbed · OWNER REFRAME
The worker closed 0040 (owner released + re-R&D'd) + 0042/0043/0044 under a **binding owner reframe**, and the
hub verified the load-bearing claims against the live tree (don't-trust-check) before absorbing.

**OWNER REFRAME (binding):** the R&D goal is **the best LINE to BUILD a golden-standard photonic language**
(secure·governed·auditable·zero-trust·fast·tri-photonic+HW-ready) — **"% already shipped" is NOT the metric.**
Tiered honesty (MACHINE-PROVEN / DESIGNED-owner-gated / ASPIRATIONAL-HW-GATED) is the METHOD, not a brake:
confirm the kernel → design forward → tier honestly. The fail-closed core (crypto/decisions stay digital +
bit-exact; photonics only at the calibrated T-MAC offload behind 0028's SNR gate) is unchanged by the reframe.

**NEW BINDING RULE (owner 2026-06-19):** anything "owner-gated" → **surface it as an explicit question
(AskUserQuestion), never silently PARK it.** A design the owner directed/re-R&D'd is GO (build it), not gated.

- **0040 — DbC OUTPUT post-conditions → BUILT (`fa9fae5`), NOT owner-gated.** **Don't-trust-check correction
  (5-agent verify + adversarial refute):** the done-record's "fail-OPEN leak" framing is **REFUTED**. A
  `result`-referencing `ensure` was HARD-REJECTED at compile time (LLN-NAME-001 symbol resolver + LLN-INV-004
  governance verifier) → never reached the emitter → no leak. The dead stubs `extractPostConditionEnsures`/
  `wrapInSingleExit` (#70) have ZERO callers; the live gate is `extractInvariantEnsures`, whose tail post-gate
  the early-return path bypasses — but that only affects PARAMETER ensures (immutable → entry gate proves them).
  So the real state was a **fail-SAFE capability gap**, not a leak. **Built the capability + enforced it
  fail-closed across every tier:** symbol-resolver scopes `result` to the ensure expr; verifier classifies it
  as an `invariant_postcondition`; interpreter `checkOutputPostconditions` traps a violating result at the
  single exit (LLN-INV-002, value never escapes); post-condition flows are EXCLUDED from the bytecode/sync/
  ExecutionGraph/cache fast tiers (three-tier fidelity — they bypass the gate) and DECLINED on WASM (→ the
  governed interpreter). +9 tests incl. a fast-path fidelity check. **Follow-ups (now AskUserQuestion items,
  not parked):** WASM single-exit `$logicn_result` lowering · Z3 discharge of decidable bounds (0024 track) ·
  `result.taint`/`result.cardinality` as compile-time governance metadata.
- **0042 — WDM tri-photonic.** MACHINE-PROVEN (re-ran `wdm-tri-photonic.mjs` exit 0): per-channel `T_k⊙(·)` ==
  shipped `decideAtBoundary`; cross-channel bank fold == `allOf` == `reduce(minTrit)` + K3 deny-annihilator
  (exhaustive 1092 vectors; 200k random banks, 0 violations). **WDM is vocabulary over the already-proven
  governance-as-T-MAC fold (0025/0035) — no new calculus, no perf claim, no bench number.** Genuine new bit =
  `.tmf`-category→wavelength-lane governance partition (per-lane isolation; crypto-on-core fence
  `LLN-SUBSTRATE-001`; fail-closed unknown). HW speed/energy/light-drop EXCLUDED-until-silicon (0028 SNR gate).
  Forward line: one wavelength = one category lane = one trust trit. **No build** (vocabulary; partition is a
  design).
- **0043 — golden-standard decision re-audit.** Per-decision KEEP/REVISE/RETIRE + sequencing (flags/profiles
  first, fail-closed core LAST) + explicit consequences-of-breaking. Re-ran the §A spine green vs the shipped
  binary (0025 9841/9841+300k · 0035 1092 · 0023 27/27 · #34 ml-dsa 20/20 · i32-findings 25/25; the 0038
  detector flips RED = fix landed). **Hub reconciliations (the tree moved under the audit):** M4 crypto-hygiene
  is **STALE for `kemdem.ts`** (timingSafeEqual + fill(0) already shipped `5c1f846`) — **still TRUE for
  `tmx256.ts`/`container.ts`** (no zeroize; container uses a non-constant-time `bytesEqual`); M3 generation-tag
  UAF guard (LSM-UAF-001) is now PRESENT (`692e62d`) though raw offset arith + absent WasmGC stand; C3 Ed25519-
  only build/sign path CONFIRMED (hybrid label is type-only). KEEP the spine; REVISE the wiring; RETIRE only the
  substrate-magic. **Design audit — no build.**
- **0044 — predictability/eigendecomposition.** MACHINE-PROVEN (re-ran `eigendecomp-skip-iteration.mjs` exit 0,
  14/14): the "O(1) skip-iteration" reduces to **0036's AOT envelope** — eigendecomp is O(N³) to compute, the
  apply `P·D^k·P⁻¹·v` is **O(N²) not O(1)** (== 0036 D2, 3.9×/doubling), chain fusion DENSIFIES 40.9× (== D4),
  and large-k breaks bit-exactness (mantissa exhaustion past 2^53). Genuine narrow kernel = a fixed-count LINEAR
  loop `V·M^k` = AOT unroll+const-fold (but LogicN loops generally aren't that shape — Computational
  Irreducibility). KEEP the irreducibility framing; REJECT universal-O(1) + the reject-non-collapsible gate.
  **No new build** (folds into 0036's plan).

**Verified this pass (don't-trust-check, all green):** 4 new benches re-ran exit 0 (wdm / eigendecomp / dbc-
output-postconditions / Z3 dbc-postcondition); i32-findings 25/25; the 0038 fail-open detector flips RED
(= production fix present). The 0040 build is the only production change; 0042/0043/0044 are verdicts/audit.

## Shipping-readiness / unblock map (what gates the *application* of the proven work)
1. **Owner-gated (production read-only — the big bucket; batch applied per owner Go 2026-06-18/19, see APPLY PHASE above):**
   - **0032 liveness hazards** — **✅ SHIPPED** `a728e44`+`a9c4ebd`+`264723a` (incl. the sync fast-path completion).
   - **0033** — crypto hygiene **✅ SHIPPED** `5c1f846`; `static-memory-pool` generation tag **✅ SHIPPED** `692e62d`; WASM handles/WasmGC for the intra-module gap — still parked (ABI).
   - **0031** `tainted` param (34A/34B); **0034** borrow-checker KB→non-goal **✅ SHIPPED** `08d6905` (the `move`/`USE_AFTER_MOVE` wiring still parked); **0035** wire the trit-fold into live reachability; **0025** governance-T-MAC decision path; GAP-2/GAP-4 engine fixes (parked).
2. **HW-gated (EXCLUDED-until-silicon):** all photonic latency/energy numbers (0028, governance-T-MAC, linear-flatten on a real T-MAC); real QRNG (IDQ Quantis); a hardware TEE; ARM-MTE/CHERI (declined — no silicon, emulate the idea via gen-tags).
3. **Env/runtime-gated:** **X1** — that the shipped tiers physically *dispatch* through the proven ops (the standing "proven-semantics ≠ proven-live-dispatch" gap; recurs in 0014/0021/0022/0023/0024/0032) — needs the 0014 fidelity harness wired into the live tiers. G3 (−6.0 Hubbard under pinned `uv.lock` WSL ffsim). Any perf number needs a named machine + reproducible bench.
4. **Solver-gated:** 0024's 2 div/rem value identities (BV-division SMT limit) — not load-bearing.
5. **External-cited (re-fetch before publishing):** the cross-language interpreter-speed numbers (§4 of the tree-walker doc, tier-ASSERTED — the research pass died on the spend limit) + the literature figures in the coverage index (vec2text, FHE, QKD attributions).

**Highest-leverage unblock:** the owner lifting the read-only gate (ship the proven-fix batch) and/or **wiring the 0014 harness into the live tiers — that single move closes X1**, the most-recurring blocked item across the whole corpus.

## The recurring honest theme (recorded — record-everything)
Every photonic/tri "game-changer" proposal oversold (O(1), `ntt_mul`, matrix-exp shortest-path, "3 parallel CPUs", quantum-erasure GC) — each audit **stripped the overclaim and kept the genuine kernel**. The real, proven wins are all **CPU-side / algebraic / fail-closed**: governance-as-min-fold, flat SoA AST, de-coloring the interpreter, ternary tombstoning, trust-trit path-authorization, and the degrade-to-DENY self-heal.
