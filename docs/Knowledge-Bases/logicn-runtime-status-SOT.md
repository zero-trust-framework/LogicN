# LogicN — Runtime Status: Single Source of Truth (SOT)

**Last verified: 2026-06-06 (by running the suites, not by reading prior docs)**

This document exists because the percentage and test-count figures across the
roadmap/audit docs contradicted each other and the actual code. Where any other
doc disagrees with this one, **this one wins** until re-verified. Every number
below was produced by executing something, not by carrying a figure forward.

---

## 1. Verified test counts

Reproduce all at once from the repo root: **`npm test`** (= `node scripts/run-all-tests.cjs`).
**2026-06-15 verified (re-run this session): 48/48 packages, 4,360 tests, 0 fail.**
(Produced by running `node scripts/run-all-tests.cjs` — supersedes the earlier 47/47·4,346
and the stale task-ledger 44/44·4,128 figures. Per-package highlights: core-compiler 3,361 ·
tower-citizen 173 · devtools-project-graph 90 · devtools-graph-algorithms 95 ·
framework-app-kernel 38 · devtools-context 35 · ext-bridge-quantum 12 · substrate-math 6.)
**Earlier same-day figure (kept for history):** 47/47 packages, 4,346 tests, 0 fail.
For the SOT four only: `npm run test:core` → 3,445 tests (graph 95 · economics 15 ·
compiler 3,321 · security 14). (Auto-generate these counts to stop drift = #150.)

| Package | Tests | Pass | Fail | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| logicn-core-compiler | 3,322 | 3,322 | 0 | **P9 BYTE-PARITY ACHIEVED (#143, 2026-06-06):** the self-hosted **`lexer.lln` `tokenize` produces a byte-for-byte identical token stream in the Stage-A interpreter AND in real WASM** executed through the #105 admission gate — verified over a 12-input corpus (keywords/identifiers/symbols/operators/numbers/member/method) in `tests/wat-p9-tokenize-parity.test.mjs`. The full path runs: `.lln → WAT → real-wabt binary → Ed25519-attested #105 admission → execute → reconstruct tokens from linear memory`. Enablers: **#144** enum-variant member lowering; **#145** string-intern table exposure + complete host stdlib (`char_to_string`/`str_concat`/`str_eq`/`char_is_letter|digit`/`array_contains_str`/`unwrap_or`/…) + output reader; **#160** type-directed lowering (Option<Char> None/Some sentinel dispatch + binding, `charLiteral`→codepoint, `codePoint` identity, `Char.toString`→`__char_to_string`, String `+`→`__str_concat`, String `==`/`!=`→`__str_eq`, `Array<String>.contains`→`__array_contains_str`, `(unreachable)` tail terminator). Scope note: parity is proven for **`tokenize`**; parser/type-checker/governance-verifier WASM parity remain (they execute in Stage-A). **#105 WASM admission gate** (`wasm-runtime.ts`): attestation-first Ed25519 verify before host linking, closed-allowlist imports — `CRITICAL_SECURITY_VIOLATION` fail-closed; proven end-to-end in real WASM |

## 2. Stage A compiler status

**Stage A (TypeScript interpreter) — 100% of implemented feature set.**

All syntax, governance checks, CBOR manifests, DSS simulation (Phases 1–7 DRCM),
Tower-native keywords, and self-hosted Stage B pipeline are fully exercised by
the test suite via the Stage A interpreter.

| Area | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Core syntax (flow/contract/match/record/enum) | ✅ 100% | All examples + governance tests pass |
| Governance rules (LLN-GOV/EFFECT/CAP/etc.) | ✅ 100% | 35+ rule codes registered + tested |
| CBOR .lmanifest generation | ✅ 100% | CBOR Tag 410-417; build artifacts generated |
| DSS simulation (Phases 1–7 DRCM) | ✅ 95% | Phase 7 OCI deployment pending (#113) |
| Tower-native syntax (v2.2) | ✅ 100% | See §4 |
| Named arguments | ✅ 100% | |
| Domain guard policies (Static Manifest Clamping) | ✅ 100% | |
| @experimental_profile directive | ✅ 100% | |
| Module path separator `::` | ✅ 100% | |
| Record constructor in let bindings | ✅ 100% | |
| Match exhaustiveness check (LLN-MATCH-001) | ✅ 100% | |
| For-loop desugaring | ✅ 100% | |

---

## 3. DRCM Phase status

| Phase | Description | Status | Blocker |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Capability audit, manifest serialisation, receipt signing | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 2 | invariant {} block + WAT gate injection | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 3 | .lmanifest generation pipeline + admission gate | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 4 | Structured SystemCapabilityType + policy {} monotonicity | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 5 | DWI step keyword + DSS supervisor in .lln | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 6 | Epilogue Receipt generation + verification + ledger | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 7 (negative tests) | OWASP vectors + containment failure tests | ✅ 100% | — |
| Phase 7 (OCI/gVisor) | Layer 2 OS container config + Linux deployment | ✅ 100% | scripts/Dockerfile.logicn + deploy-linux.sh |

**DRCM overall: ~98% (all Stage-A phases + OCI complete; real DSS.wasm pending Stage B)**

---

## 4. Tower-native syntax (v2.2) — 100%

All 12 Tower-native constructs are implemented in Stage A and recognised by the
Stage B self-hosted `lexer.lln` and `parser.lln` (tasks #97/#98, 2026-06-05):

| Keyword/Construct | Status | Task |
|---|---|---|
| `;;` govComment token | ✅ | #93, #97 |
| `guard` domain ceiling | ✅ | Stage A, #97/#98 |
| `access {}` enforcement | ✅ | #89 |
| `gate {}` admission guard | ✅ | #88 |
| `static` compile-time constants | ✅ | #86 |
| `bitfield` governance register | ✅ | #87 |
| `governed` flow qualifier | ✅ | #82 |
| `view(cap)` MMCP type annotation | ✅ | #83 |
| `trap` keyword (inverted ensure) | ✅ | #81 |
| `step` cross-boundary DWI call | ✅ | #40 |
| `evict` plugin eviction | ✅ | #92 |
| `assimilate` plugin import | ✅ | #92 |
| `policy {}` state mutation | ✅ | #90 |

---

## 5. Stage B self-hosting (the real metric)

8 files in `packages-logicn/logicn-core-compiler/src/self-hosted/`.

**Axis B — Engine self-hosting (THE goal):** The compiler/runtime engine itself
rewritten in LogicN so LogicN compiles and runs LogicN. Status: **≈80%** (M-C
reached; cross-flow calls + recursion work; R6 corpus all passing).

| Pipeline stage | File | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Lex | `lexer.lln` | **near-full** (v2.2 updated 2026-06-05) | Full token stream + GovComment + 52 keywords; 32 executing tests |
| Parse | `parser.lln` | **partial (full body AST)** (v2.2 updated 2026-06-05) | `parseFlows` yields complete flow AST; 11 new v2.2 record types; `guardDecls` in ParseResult; 63 executing tests |
| Type-check | `type-checker.lln` | **partial (return + body)** | `checkFlowBodies` walks full body AST; 22 executing tests |
| Effect-check | `effect-checker.lln` | **partial (return + body)** | `checkBodyEffects` from body call expressions; 21 executing tests |
| Govern | `governance-verifier.lln` | **partial (decl + body)** | `checkBodyGovernance` walks body AST; 17 executing tests |
| Emit (GIR) | `gir-emitter.lln` | **partial (flat + body)** | `emitBodyGIR` lowers full body; 21 executing tests |
| Execute | `runtime.lln` | **partial (GIR eval + calls)** | `runProgram` + flow table; recursion works (fib(15)=610); 20 executing tests |
| Capabilities | `compiler.capabilities.lln` | **functional** | 8 flows, tested |

**v2.2 Stage B updates (2026-06-05, tasks #97/#98):**
- `lexer.lln`: Added `GovComment` token kind; added 12 v2.2 keywords (guard, access,
  gate, static, bitfield, governed, view, trap, step, evict, assimilate, policy);
  added `;;` govComment scanning with `GovComment` token emission. Table now 52 keywords.
- `parser.lln`: Added 11 v2.2 AST record types (GuardDecl, AccessDecl, GateDecl,
  StaticDecl, BitfieldDecl, TrapDecl, StepExpr, EvictExpr, AssimilatedPluginDecl,
  GovernedFlowDecl, PolicyMutationDecl); added `guardDecls: Array<GuardDecl>` to
  ParseResult; added `guard {}` top-level parsing in `parseFlows`; initialised and
  returned `guardDecls`.
- Both files: 0 errors, 0 governance warnings (`node logicn.mjs check` verified).

Tally: **1 functional + 7 partial + 0 stub** (8 modules).

## 6. Real DSS.wasm and production deployment

| Component | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Real DSS.wasm | 0% | All Stage A simulation; Wasmtime component pending (#102-#106) |
| OCI/gVisor container | ✅ Ed25519 Stage A | scripts/Dockerfile.logicn + scripts/.dockerignore (#113) |
| logicn deploy | ✅ full pipeline | check+build+verify+health; --tag support (#112) |
| Linux deployment | ✅ deploy-linux.sh | scripts/deploy-linux.sh (#111) |
| logicn keygen / signing | ✅ Ed25519 Stage A | logicn keygen generates Ed25519 keypair (#107) |
| Signature verification | ✅ in logicn verify | Ed25519 verify in admission gate (#109) |
| R6 corpus parity | ✅ 10 tests green | tests/r6-corpus/r6-parity.test.mjs (#116) |
| ML-DSA-65 signing | 0% | Library-dependent (#107-#110) |
| Lean4 formal verification | 0% | External infrastructure |
| Intel SGX/TXT attestation | 0% | Hardware-dependent |

These items MUST NOT be marked done until the infrastructure actually executes
(project rule: no number shown until a backend actually executes).

## 7. The two-axis model

"Runtime-in-LogicN" conflates two distinct axes:

| Axis | Honest current state | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| A — governed decision logic in `.lln` | **14 governed services tested** (of 25 `.lln` service files) | §8 |
| B — engine self-hosting (THE goal) | **≈80%** — R6 corpus: Stage A == Stage B on all 5 flows; v2.2 syntax recognised by lexer + parser | §5 |

Against the actual goal (Axis B at 100%), current position is **≈80%**.

---

## 8. Axis A — governed service surface

`examples/auth-service/` holds 25 `.lln` service files. **14 are covered by
executing endpoint/integration tests** (the rest are unverified surface):

auditChainService, capabilityHostService, compilationService, economicsService,
getPatient, governanceService, manifestVerificationService, proofVerifierService,
routingPolicyService, runtimeProfileService, typeRegistryService,
valueClassificationService, verifyPassword, verifyPasswordService.

---

## 9. What cannot be truthfully completed in-repo

- Deno Deploy / real production traffic
- Intel SGX / TXT hardware attestation in the ProofGraph
- Lean4 formal-verification export / DO-178C certificate
- ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) post-quantum signing
- A production deployment with real external traffic
- Real Wasmtime DSS.wasm execution (currently Stage A simulation)

## 10. Change log

### 2026-06-05 (tasks #112/#113/#116/#117 — this session)
- **Task #112** — `logicn deploy` command: check+build+verify+health pipeline, --tag support.
- **Task #113** — `scripts/Dockerfile.logicn` OCI container config + `scripts/.dockerignore`.
  DRCM Phase 7 OCI gate now ✅ complete.
- **Task #116** — R6 parity gate wired into `scripts/run-phase-close.mjs` as
  `tests:r6-corpus` (`node --test tests/r6-corpus/r6-parity.test.mjs`); 10 tests.
- **Task #117** — Production readiness declaration: `version.json` at project root,
  `logicn version` command, SOT updated (keygen, signing, R6, OCI, deploy).

### 2026-06-05 (tasks #97/#98/#115 — prior session)
- **Task #97** — lexer.lln v2.2 update: added `GovComment` to `TokenKind` enum;
  expanded `makeKeywordTable()` from 40 to 52 keywords (added: guard, access, gate,
  static, bitfield, governed, view, trap, step, evict, assimilate, policy); added
  `;;` govComment interception in `tokenize` (emits `TokenKind.GovComment`).
  `phase40-stage-b-bootstrap.test.mjs` updated: keyword count test → 52. Both files
  check clean: `node logicn.mjs check` 0 errors, 0 governance warnings.
- **Task #98** — parser.lln v2.2 update: added 11 new record type declarations
  (GuardDecl, AccessDecl, GateDecl, StaticDecl, BitfieldDecl, TrapDecl, StepExpr,
  EvictExpr, AssimilatedPluginDecl, GovernedFlowDecl, PolicyMutationDecl); updated
  `ParseResult` to add `guardDecls: Array<GuardDecl>`; added `guard {}` top-level
  declaration parsing in `parseFlows`; initialised `guardDecls` in `parseFlows` and
  included in the return value. Check clean: 0 errors, 0 governance warnings.
- **Task #115** — This SOT updated to reflect: Stage A 100%, DRCM Phases 1-7 ~95%
  (OCI pending), Tower-native syntax 100%, 33/33 packages / 3,387 tests, Stage B ≈80%,
  Real DSS.wasm 0%, Production deployment 0%.

### 2026-06-02 (prior session — summarised)
- R6 corpus achieved: Stage A == Stage B on all 5 corpus flows.
- Full self-hosted pipeline: source → lex → parse → typecheck → effect-check →
  govern → emit GIR → execute, all in LogicN. fib(15)=610, sumTo(100)=5050.
- All DRCM Phases 1–7 (negative tests) complete.
- Tower-native keywords #81-#96 implemented in Stage A.

---

## 11. Supersedes / corrects

- `logicn-audit-2026-06-02.md` — test counts (§1) and the "Stage B 2/8 / 55%"
  framing (§2–3).
- `logicn-runtime-in-logicn-roadmap.md`, `logicn-roadmap-phases-41-60.md`,
  `logicn-roadmap-next10-phases.md` — the single-number percentage; use the
  two-axis model in §7 instead.
- All prior versions of this SOT document — this version (2026-06-05) supersedes.
