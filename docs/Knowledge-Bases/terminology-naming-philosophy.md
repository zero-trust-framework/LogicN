# Terminology And Naming Philosophy

## Purpose

LogicN terminology should remain stable, understandable, future-proof,
AI-readable and operationally meaningful as the project evolves into:

```text
a governed compute orchestration platform
```

This applies across:

```text
runtime systems
compiler systems
governance systems
AI systems
hardware systems
documentation
APIs
IR structures
reports
```

## Core Principle

```text
Names must describe responsibility,
not implementation detail.
```

## Why Naming Matters

Reactive naming creates:

```text
inconsistent terminology
overlapping concepts
ambiguous architecture
AI confusion
documentation drift
unstable APIs
breaking conceptual models
```

LogicN should use intentional terminology architecture from the beginning.

## Naming Priorities

| Priority | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Operational clarity |
| 2 | AI readability |
| 3 | Future-proof meaning |
| 4 | Stable conceptual mapping |
| 5 | Human understandability |
| 6 | Implementation independence |
| 7 | Minimal ambiguity |

## Responsibility-Based Names

Prefer names based on:

```text
responsibility
purpose
operational behavior
governance role
execution role
```

Avoid names based on:

```text
current implementation details
temporary technologies
specific hardware
current programming trends
legacy CPU assumptions
```

Example to avoid:

```text
ThreadManager
```

Problem:

```text
assumes threads are always the execution model
```

Better:

```text
Execution Coordination
```

Reason:

```text
describes operational responsibility,
not implementation mechanism
```

## Naming Rules

### 1. Prefer Responsibility-Based Names

Good:

```text
Authority Control
Runtime Logistics
Execution Coordination
Result Assembly
```

Avoid:

```text
ThreadManager
TaskRunner
ServiceHandler
UtilityProcessor
```

### 2. Avoid Temporary Technology Names

Avoid:

```text
GPUManager
ThreadScheduler
PhotonicController
```

Prefer:

```text
Resource Deployment
Execution Coordination
Compute Classification
```

Hardware may change. Responsibilities should remain stable.

### 3. Avoid Ambiguous Generic Terms

Avoid:

```text
Manager
Helper
Handler
Processor
Service
```

Prefer:

```text
Control
Coordination
Deployment
Verification
Classification
Assembly
```

### 4. Design For AI Interpretation

AI systems are first-class readers of LogicN architecture.

Names should:

```text
map cleanly to responsibility
avoid overloaded meaning
avoid contextual guessing
avoid unnecessary abbreviation
```

Good:

```text
Execution Coordination Scheduler
```

Less ideal:

```text
ECS
```

### 5. Avoid Excessive Theme Naming

Operational terminology is useful. Vague theme naming is not.

Avoid:

```text
Knight
Guardian
Overseer
Execution Paladin
```

Prefer:

```text
Authority Control
Runtime Logistics
Execution Coordination
```

### 6. Avoid CPU-First Assumptions

LogicN terminology should remain compute-neutral.

Future compute may include:

```text
optical systems
wave systems
tensor fabrics
heterogeneous compute
AI-native accelerators
signal-flow execution
asynchronous compute graphs
accelerator pipelines
```

Names should describe execution responsibility rather than current hardware.

### 7. Separate Governance From Execution

Governance systems should be named differently from execution systems.

| Governance | Execution |
| --- | --- |
| Authority Control | Execution Coordination |
| Policy Verification | Resource Deployment |
| Capability Validation | Result Assembly |
| Boundary Enforcement | Compute Execution |

This improves security reasoning, AI indexing and architecture auditing.

### 8. Use Classification Terminology

LogicN increasingly classifies:

```text
execution nature
hardware suitability
compute density
conversion economics
governance level
scheduling strategy
memory shape
trust state
```

Prefer:

```text
Execution Classification
```

over:

```text
Hot Path Optimizer
```

because classification describes the responsibility before optimization.

### 9. Preserve Long-Term Stability

Major architectural terminology should rarely change.

Stable names improve:

```text
documentation durability
AI indexing
architecture consistency
contributor onboarding
long-term governance
API stability
```

## Naming Layers

### Governance Layer

Examples:

```text
Authority Control
Policy Verification
Capability Validation
Boundary Enforcement
Audit Proof
```

Purpose:

```text
govern execution authority
```

### Coordination Layer

Examples:

```text
Runtime Command
Execution Coordination
Runtime Logistics
Resource Deployment
```

Purpose:

```text
coordinate governed compute
```

### Execution Layer

Examples:

```text
Compute Execution
Tensor Pipelines
Signal Processing
Optical Compute
Result Assembly
```

Purpose:

```text
perform approved execution
```

## Critical Questions For New Terms

When introducing a runtime, compiler, AI, governance or hardware term, ask:

```text
Does this describe responsibility?
Is the name implementation-independent?
Will this still make sense in 10 years?
Can AI infer the role from the name?
Does the name imply hidden behavior?
Does the name preserve authority boundaries?
```

## Platform Identity

LogicN should be described as:

```text
a governed compute orchestration platform
```

or:

```text
an operational compute coordination system
```

The strongest technical identity is:

```text
a governed operational fabric for heterogeneous compute
```

because it captures:

```text
governance
orchestration
heterogeneous hardware
execution planning
runtime coordination
AI-native compute
structured auditability
```

## Naming Principle For Product Identity

The name should describe:

```text
governed orchestration of compute
```

not merely:

```text
execution of code
```

Potential naming categories may include governance, operational
infrastructure, AI-native runtime, future hardware and security-heavy names.
Any future branding decision should preserve the architecture rule: name the
responsibility, not the temporary implementation.

## Final Philosophy

```text
Traditional software names often describe code structures.

LogicN terminology should describe
governed operational responsibility.
```

## Final Principle

```text
Name systems by what responsibility they own,
not by how they are temporarily implemented.
```
