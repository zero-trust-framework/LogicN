# Effect Checker and Boundary Checker

## Status

```text
Package: galerina-core-compiler
Area: effect checker and boundary checker
Version target: v0.2
Implementation status: fully specified, implementation pending
Canonical diagnostic ranges: FUNGI-EFFECT-001 through FUNGI-EFFECT-004, FUNGI-BOUNDARY-001 through FUNGI-BOUNDARY-004
Primary compiler outputs: effect graph, boundary graph, runtime manifest input metadata
```

The effect checker and boundary checker are complementary compiler systems.

| Component | Question answered |
| --- | --- |
| Effect checker | What authority does this code require? |
| Boundary checker | Is that authority allowed to cross this boundary? |

Together they turn Galerina source into machine-readable governance metadata:

```text
source code -> checked program -> effect graph -> boundary graph -> runtime manifest
```

They must fail closed. If the compiler cannot prove that an effect or boundary crossing is safe, the build must emit diagnostics and refuse to treat the program as deployment-safe.

---

## Design Goals

```text
explicit authority
transitive effect propagation
fail-closed boundary checks
deterministic diagnostics
runtime-manifest-ready metadata
AI-readable compiler output
safe API/package/runtime boundaries
no silent authority widening
```

The systems do not grant authority. They only identify, validate, and report authority that source code explicitly requires.

---

## Compiler Pipeline Position

The effect checker runs after parsing, binding, and type checking. The boundary checker runs after effect inference and propagation.

```text
lexer
  -> parser
  -> AST normalisation
  -> symbol binding
  -> type checker
  -> effect inference
  -> effect graph construction
  -> effect propagation
  -> boundary graph construction
  -> boundary validation
  -> capability resolution
  -> runtime manifest generation
```

The runtime manifest generator consumes both graphs. It must not invent effects, boundaries, or capabilities that these passes did not produce.

---

## Canonical Effect Categories

```ts
export type EffectCategory =
  | "network"
  | "database"
  | "filesystem"
  | "environment"
  | "secret"
  | "process"
  | "memory"
  | "compute"
  | "ai"
  | "interop"
```

These categories are policy groupings. Individual effects may be more specific:

```text
network.http.request
database.read
database.write
filesystem.read
filesystem.write
secret.read
process.spawn
ai.inference
interop.native_call
```

---

## Effect Interface

```ts
export interface Effect {
  id: string

  /**
   * Human-readable effect name.
   * Examples: "network", "database.write", "secret.read".
   */
  name: string

  /**
   * Category used for deployment policy and target compatibility checks.
   */
  category: EffectCategory

  /**
   * Unsafe effects require explicit permission or capability approval.
   */
  unsafe: boolean

  /**
   * Boundary-sensitive effects must be checked at package/API/runtime boundaries.
   */
  boundarySensitive: boolean

  /**
   * Optional runtime capability required before this effect may execute.
   */
  requiredCapability?: string
}
```

Example registry entry:

```ts
export const NETWORK_HTTP_REQUEST: Effect = {
  id: "effect.network.http.request",
  name: "network.http.request",
  category: "network",
  unsafe: true,
  boundarySensitive: true,
  requiredCapability: "NetworkRequest"
}
```

---

## EffectReference

The checker should use lightweight references inside graphs and checked IR.

```ts
export interface EffectReference {
  /** Stable name from the effect registry. */
  name: string

  /** Source location that caused the effect, if known. */
  sourceLocation?: SourceLocation

  /** True when the effect came from a callee rather than the local body. */
  inherited?: boolean

  /** Function id that introduced this inherited effect. */
  inheritedFromFunctionId?: string
}
```

---

## CheckedFunction Interface

Every checked function must carry effect and boundary metadata.

```ts
export interface CheckedFunction {
  id: string
  name: string

  /** Effects explicitly declared in the function signature. */
  declaredEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Effects inferred directly from this function's body. */
  inferredEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Effects inherited from called functions after propagation. */
  transitiveEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Effective effects = declared + inferred + transitive, normalised by name. */
  effectiveEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Function ids called by this function. */
  outgoingCalls: string[]

  /** Boundary requirements found in this function or inherited from callees. */
  boundaryRequirements: BoundaryRequirement[]

  diagnostics: CompilerDiagnostic[]
}
```

---

## EffectGraphNode Interface

```ts
export interface EffectGraphNode {
  functionId: string

  /** Direct call edges from this function to callees. */
  outgoingCalls: string[]

  /** Reverse call edges used for explain output and propagation debugging. */
  incomingCalls: string[]

  /** Effects declared by the function. */
  declaredEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Effects inferred from the local function body. */
  inferredEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Effects inherited from callees after propagation. */
  transitiveEffects: EffectReference[]
}
```

---

## EffectGraph Interface

```ts
export interface EffectGraph {
  nodes: EffectGraphNode[]
  nodeMap: Map<string, EffectGraphNode>
}
```

The graph must be deterministic. Nodes should be sorted by `functionId` before serialisation or manifest generation.

---

## Effect Inference

Effect inference walks checked AST or checked IR and records operations that require runtime authority.

```ts
export function inferExpressionEffects(
  expression: CheckedExpression
): EffectReference[] {
  switch (expression.kind) {
    case "HttpCallExpression":
      return [{ name: "network.http.request", sourceLocation: expression.sourceLocation }]

    case "DatabaseQueryExpression":
      return [{ name: "database.read", sourceLocation: expression.sourceLocation }]

    case "DatabaseMutationExpression":
      return [{ name: "database.write", sourceLocation: expression.sourceLocation }]

    case "SecretReadExpression":
      return [{ name: "secret.read", sourceLocation: expression.sourceLocation }]

    case "ShellExecExpression":
      return [{ name: "process.spawn", sourceLocation: expression.sourceLocation }]

    case "AiInferenceExpression":
      return [{ name: "ai.inference", sourceLocation: expression.sourceLocation }]

    default:
      return []
  }
}
```

---

## Effect Propagation

Effects propagate through the call graph.

If:

```text
route -> flow -> fn
```

and the `fn` performs `database.write`, then the `flow` — and by extension the `route` that called it — also has a transitive `database.write` effect.

---

## propagateEffects() Iterative Fixpoint

A fixpoint algorithm is required so recursive and multi-hop call graphs stabilise deterministically.

```ts
export function propagateEffects(
  graph: EffectGraph
): EffectGraph {
  let changed = true

  while (changed) {
    changed = false

    for (const node of graph.nodes) {
      for (const childId of node.outgoingCalls) {
        const child = graph.nodeMap.get(childId)

        if (!child) {
          continue
        }

        const childEffects = [
          ...child.inferredEffects,
          ...child.transitiveEffects
        ]

        for (const effect of childEffects) {
          if (!containsEffect(node.transitiveEffects, effect.name)) {
            node.transitiveEffects.push({
              ...effect,
              inherited: true,
              inheritedFromFunctionId: child.functionId
            })

            changed = true
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }

  return graph
}

function containsEffect(
  effects: EffectReference[],
  effectName: string
): boolean {
  return effects.some(effect => effect.name === effectName)
}
```

---

## Effect Validation Rules

After propagation, the checker validates declared, inferred, and transitive effects.

```ts
export function validateFunctionEffects(
  fn: CheckedFunction,
  registry: EffectRegistry,
  target: RuntimeTarget
): CompilerDiagnostic[] {
  const diagnostics: CompilerDiagnostic[] = []

  for (const effect of fn.effectiveEffects) {
    if (!registry.has(effect.name)) {
      diagnostics.push({
        code: "FUNGI-EFFECT-001",
        severity: "error",
        message: `Unknown or undeclared effect ${effect.name}.`,
        sourceLocation: effect.sourceLocation
      })
    }

    if (!isEffectAllowedOnTarget(effect.name, target)) {
      diagnostics.push({
        code: "FUNGI-EFFECT-002",
        severity: "error",
        message: `Effect ${effect.name} is forbidden for target ${target}.`,
        sourceLocation: effect.sourceLocation
      })
    }
  }

  for (const transitive of fn.transitiveEffects) {
    if (!containsEffect(fn.declaredEffects, transitive.name)) {
      diagnostics.push({
        code: "FUNGI-EFFECT-004",
        severity: "error",
        message: `Function ${fn.name} inherits ${transitive.name} but does not declare it.`,
        sourceLocation: transitive.sourceLocation
      })
    }
  }

  return diagnostics
}
```

## Canonical FUNGI-EFFECT Codes

| Code | Meaning | Severity | Typical fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FUNGI-EFFECT-001` | Unknown or undeclared effect | error | Declare the effect or add it to the registry |
| `FUNGI-EFFECT-002` | Effect forbidden for selected target | error | Change target or remove the effect |
| `FUNGI-EFFECT-003` | Effect escalation detected | error | Narrow callee authority or update capability policy |
| `FUNGI-EFFECT-004` | Transitive effect mismatch | error/warning | Declare inherited effect or remove effectful call |

`FUNGI-EFFECT-001` through `FUNGI-EFFECT-004` are the canonical v0.2 compiler codes for this checker. Older `FUNGI-E4*` codes may remain as compatibility aliases in CLI output, but new reports should use the `FUNGI-EFFECT-*` range.

---

## Boundary Types

```ts
export type BoundaryType =
  | "api"
  | "webhook"
  | "worker"
  | "job"
  | "network"
  | "database"
  | "secret"
  | "filesystem"
  | "ffi"
  | "ai"
  | "wasm"
```

---

## Boundary Interface

```ts
export interface Boundary {
  id: string

  type: BoundaryType

  /** Trust level at this boundary. */
  trustLevel:
    | "untrusted"
    | "validated"
    | "internal"
    | "privileged"

  /** Effects explicitly allowed to cross the boundary. */
  allowedEffects: string[]

  /** Effects explicitly denied at this boundary. */
  deniedEffects: string[]

  /** Runtime or deployment policies required before execution. */
  requiredPolicies: BoundaryPolicy[]
}
```

---

## BoundaryRequirement Interface

```ts
export interface BoundaryRequirement {
  boundaryType: BoundaryType

  /** Input validation must run before crossing this boundary. */
  requiresValidation: boolean

  /** Caller identity or route auth is required. */
  requiresAuth: boolean

  /** Rate limiting is required for public/API boundaries. */
  requiresRateLimit: boolean

  /** Replay protection is required for webhooks and signed callbacks. */
  requiresReplayProtection: boolean

  /** Secrets must be redacted or kept as SecretReference values. */
  requiresSecretProtection: boolean
}
```

---

## BoundaryGraph

```ts
export interface BoundaryNode {
  id: string
  boundary: Boundary
}

export interface BoundaryEdge {
  from: string
  to: string

  /** Effects transferred through this boundary edge. */
  transferredEffects: string[]

  /** Secret references transferred through this edge. Raw secrets are forbidden. */
  transferredSecrets: string[]

  requiresValidation: boolean
}

export interface BoundaryGraph {
  boundaries: BoundaryNode[]
  edges: BoundaryEdge[]
}
```

---

## Boundary Validation

```ts
export function validateBoundaryEdge(
  edge: BoundaryEdge,
  boundary: Boundary
): CompilerDiagnostic[] {
  const diagnostics: CompilerDiagnostic[] = []

  for (const effect of edge.transferredEffects) {
    if (boundary.deniedEffects.includes(effect)) {
      diagnostics.push({
        code: "FUNGI-BOUNDARY-001",
        severity: "error",
        message: `Effect ${effect} is denied at boundary ${boundary.id}.`
      })
    }

    if (
      boundary.allowedEffects.length > 0 &&
      !boundary.allowedEffects.includes(effect)
    ) {
      diagnostics.push({
        code: "FUNGI-BOUNDARY-002",
        severity: "error",
        message: `Effect ${effect} is not allowed at boundary ${boundary.id}.`
      })
    }
  }

  if (edge.transferredSecrets.length > 0 && boundary.type !== "secret") {
    diagnostics.push({
      code: "FUNGI-BOUNDARY-003",
      severity: "error",
      message: `Secret values cannot cross ${boundary.type} boundary ${boundary.id}.`
    })
  }

  if (edge.requiresValidation && !hasValidationPolicy(boundary)) {
    diagnostics.push({
      code: "FUNGI-BOUNDARY-004",
      severity: "error",
      message: `Boundary ${boundary.id} requires validation policy before execution.`
    })
  }

  return diagnostics
}
```

---

## Canonical FUNGI-BOUNDARY Codes

| Code | Meaning | Severity | Typical fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FUNGI-BOUNDARY-001` | Denied effect crosses boundary | error | Remove effect or change boundary policy |
| `FUNGI-BOUNDARY-002` | Effect not present in boundary allowlist | error | Add explicit allow policy or move code behind safer boundary |
| `FUNGI-BOUNDARY-003` | Secret or protected value crosses unsafe boundary | error | Use SecretReference/redaction or keep secret inside secret boundary |
| `FUNGI-BOUNDARY-004` | Required boundary policy missing | error | Add validation/auth/rate-limit/replay/secret policy |

`FUNGI-BOUNDARY-001` through `FUNGI-BOUNDARY-004` are the canonical v0.2 compiler codes for this checker. Older expanded boundary codes may be retained in historical reports, but new compiler reports should use the four-code canonical range above.

---

## Checked IR: CheckedCallExpression

Checked call expressions connect type checking, effect propagation, and boundary checking.

```ts
export interface CheckedCallExpression {
  kind: "CheckedCallExpression"

  /** Function id resolved during binding/type checking. */
  targetFunctionId: string

  argumentTypes: CheckedType[]

  /** Effects inferred from the call target. */
  inferredEffects: EffectReference[]

  /** Boundary requirements introduced by this call. */
  boundaryRequirements: BoundaryRequirement[]

  sourceLocation: SourceLocation
}
```

---

## Example: Network Effect

```galerina
pub fn load_profile(http: HttpClient, id: UserId)
    -> Result<UserProfile, NetworkError>
    effect network
{
    return http.get("/users/" + id)
}
```

Compiler result:

```json
{
  "flow": "load_profile",
  "declaredEffects": ["network"],
  "inferredEffects": ["network.http.request"],
  "transitiveEffects": [],
  "result": "pass"
}
```

---

## Example: Missing Transitive Effect

```galerina
pub fn load_profile(http: HttpClient, id: UserId)
    -> Result<UserProfile, NetworkError>
    effect network
{
    return http.get("/users/" + id)
}

pub fn render_profile_page(http: HttpClient, id: UserId) -> Html {
    let profile = load_profile(http, id)
    return render(profile)
}
```

`render_profile_page` inherits `network` from `load_profile`. If it does not declare that effect, the checker emits:

```text
FUNGI-EFFECT-004: Function render_profile_page inherits network but does not declare it.
```

Corrected:

```galerina
pub fn render_profile_page(http: HttpClient, id: UserId)
    -> Html
    effect network
{
    let profile = load_profile(http, id)
    return render(profile)
}
```

---

## Example: Secret Boundary Failure

```galerina
pub fn debug_secret(secret: SecretString) {
    print(secret)
}
```

The boundary checker must reject this because a protected secret crosses a runtime/logging boundary.

```text
FUNGI-BOUNDARY-003: Secret values cannot cross runtime boundary runtime.print.
```

Corrected:

```galerina
pub fn debug_secret(secret: SecretString) {
    print(secret.redacted())
}
```

---

## Example: API Boundary Failure

```galerina
route POST "/admin/restart" {
    process.spawn("systemctl restart app")
}
```

A public API route cannot directly cross into process execution unless an explicit privileged policy exists.

```text
FUNGI-BOUNDARY-001: Effect process.spawn is denied at boundary api.public.
```

Corrected design:

```galerina
route POST "/admin/restart"
    auth AdminOnly
    policy privileged_operation
{
    enqueue_restart_job()
}
```

The route should enqueue a governed job rather than directly spawning a process from the public API boundary.

---

## Example: WASM Target Boundary

```galerina
target wasm

pub fn read_local_file(path: Text) -> Text
    effect filesystem
{
    return filesystem.read(path)
}
```

The target policy rejects this because direct filesystem access is not allowed for the selected WASM target.

```text
FUNGI-EFFECT-002: Effect filesystem.read is forbidden for target wasm.
```

---

## Runtime Manifest Feed

The effect checker and boundary checker feed pass 14 manifest generation.

```ts
export interface FunctionManifest {
  id: string
  name: string
  declaredEffects: string[]
  inferredEffects: string[]
  transitiveEffects: string[]
  boundaries: string[]
  capabilities: string[]
}

export interface EffectManifest {
  name: string
  category: string
  unsafe: boolean
  boundarySensitive: boolean
  requiredCapability?: string
}

export interface BoundaryManifest {
  id: string
  type: string
  trustLevel: string
  allowedEffects: string[]
  deniedEffects: string[]
  requiredPolicies: string[]
}
```

Example function manifest:

```json
{
  "id": "fn.render_profile_page",
  "name": "render_profile_page",
  "declaredEffects": ["network"],
  "inferredEffects": [],
  "transitiveEffects": ["network.http.request"],
  "boundaries": ["api.public"],
  "capabilities": ["NetworkRequest"]
}
```

---

## Reports

The checker should produce both human-readable and machine-readable report data.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "galerina.effect-boundary-report.v0.2",
  "effects": {
    "functionCount": 12,
    "effectfulFunctionCount": 5,
    "diagnostics": []
  },
  "boundaries": {
    "boundaryCount": 4,
    "deniedEdges": 0,
    "diagnostics": []
  }
}
```

---

---

## Test Strategy

```ts
describe("effect propagation", () => {
  it("inherits network effects through the call graph", () => {
    const graph = createFixtureGraph({
      root: ["loadProfile"],
      loadProfile: []
    })

    graph.nodeMap.get("loadProfile")?.inferredEffects.push({
      name: "network.http.request"
    })

    propagateEffects(graph)

    expect(
      graph.nodeMap.get("root")?.transitiveEffects.some(effect =>
        effect.name === "network.http.request"
      )
    ).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

```ts
describe("boundary checker", () => {
  it("rejects secrets crossing non-secret boundaries", () => {
    const diagnostics = validateBoundaryEdge(
      {
        from: "fn.loadSecret",
        to: "runtime.print",
        transferredEffects: [],
        transferredSecrets: ["SecretString"],
        requiresValidation: false
      },
      {
        id: "runtime.print",
        type: "api",
        trustLevel: "validated",
        allowedEffects: [],
        deniedEffects: [],
        requiredPolicies: []
      }
    )

    expect(diagnostics.some(d => d.code === "FUNGI-BOUNDARY-003")).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

---

## Fail-Closed Rules

The compiler must never:

```text
silently ignore unknown effects
silently widen authority
silently allow a denied boundary crossing
silently pass raw secrets into logs, reports, APIs, or AI prompts
silently downgrade target policy
silently treat missing boundary policy as safe
```

If metadata is incomplete, the checker must produce diagnostics and prevent the build from being marked deployment-safe.

---

## Relationship to Other Systems

```text
effect checker       -> feeds capability resolver and runtime manifest
boundary checker     -> feeds deployment policy, API server, reports, and audit metadata
runtime manifest     -> consumes function/effect/boundary metadata
galerina explain       -> explains effect inheritance and boundary decisions
galerina deploy        -> validates manifest against target policy
galerina-core-security -> supplies secret-safe boundaries and redaction rules
galerina-core-network  -> supplies network destination policies
```

---

## Summary

The effect checker identifies what code can do. The boundary checker decides whether that authority may safely cross a specific trust, package, API, runtime, or target boundary.

For v0.2, the canonical compiler contracts are:

```text
Effect
CheckedFunction
EffectGraphNode
EffectGraph
Boundary
BoundaryRequirement
BoundaryEdge
BoundaryGraph
CheckedCallExpression
```

The canonical diagnostic ranges are:

```text
FUNGI-EFFECT-001 through FUNGI-EFFECT-004
FUNGI-BOUNDARY-001 through FUNGI-BOUNDARY-004
```

These systems are required before Galerina can truthfully claim governed execution, runtime authority control, deployment-safe manifests, or audit-grade execution proof.
