# Authority Model

## Definition

LogicN separates authority into two distinct layers that work together:

```text
Compile-time authority — what the code declares it needs
Runtime authority — what the runtime verifies and grants before execution
```

Neither layer trusts the other unconditionally. Both are required.

## Two Layers

### Compile-Time Authority

The compiler checks that:

```text
fn declarations cannot request uses or permissions (compiler error LNN-SEC-014)
flow declarations explicitly list uses or permission use
capabilities required by a flow match declared actor requirements
effects declared match actual code actions
data exposure declared matches view rules
```

At compile time, LogicN can generate a static authority map:

```text
get_order requires:
  actor capability: orders.read
  code effects: db.read, audit.write
  data exposure: view.public
```

This static map is embedded in the Governed IR and Trust Capsule.

### Runtime Authority

Before a flow executes, the runtime verifies:

```text
actor has the required capabilities (from ctx.actor.capabilities)
flow is permitted under the active runtime profile
trust capsule is valid and signed
package is verified
runtime budget is available
```

Authority Control (the LSGR runtime component responsible for governance) makes
this decision. It does not delegate the decision to user code.

## Developer-Facing: permission

Developers write `permission use name` to declare authority:

```logicn
secure flow update_user_email(
  request: UpdateEmailRequest,
  contex: RequestContext
) -> Result<UserResponse, ApiError>
  permission use user_email_update
{
  ...
}

permission user_email_update {
  actor {
    require users.email.update
    require users.private.read
  }
  code {
    allow db.read
    allow db.write
    allow audit.write
    deny network.external
  }
  data {
    allow expose view: public
    allow expose view: private with users.private.read
    deny expose view: secret
  }
  audit {
    required true
    event "user.email.update"
  }
}
```

A permission compiles into: actor authority + code effects + data exposure rules + audit requirements.

## Developer-Facing: uses

For simpler authority declarations without full permission blocks:

```logicn
flow cleanup_sessions() -> CleanupResult
  uses database.sessions.write
{
  ...
}
```

`uses` declares a specific runtime resource the flow needs. The runtime verifies
the flow is granted that resource before execution begins.

## Authority Does Not Propagate Silently

A flow calling another flow does not inherit authority automatically:

```logicn
flow get_order(id: safe OrderId) -> Order
  uses database.orders.read
{
  let raw: unsafe Any = database.orders.find(id)
  return validate.order(raw)
}

flow process_order(id: safe OrderId) -> Receipt
  uses database.orders.read      // must also declare its own uses
  uses channel.payments.write
{
  let order: Order = get_order(id)   // get_order runs under its own declared authority
  let raw: unsafe Any = payments.send(order)
  return validate.receipt(raw)
}
```

Each flow must declare its own required authority. Calling a flow does not
grant the caller the callee's authority, nor does it grant the callee any extra
authority beyond what the callee itself declared.

## fn Has No Authority

`fn` is a pure local helper. It cannot declare authority:

```logicn
// Compiler error LNN-SEC-014
fn bad_helper()
  uses database.orders.read   // ERROR: fn cannot declare uses
{
  ...
}
```

All authority must live in `flow`.

## Comparison: Compile-Time vs Runtime

| Check | Compile-Time | Runtime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fn` declares `uses` | Error LNN-SEC-014 | — |
| `flow` declares `uses` without matching code | Warning | — |
| Actor has required capability | Static analysis | Hard check |
| Trust capsule valid | — | Verified before execution |
| Runtime profile allows this flow | — | Verified before execution |
| Budget available | — | Checked during execution |

## AI-Generated Code Authority

AI-generated code is risk-scored automatically:

```text
Low risk (formatting, no privileged authority) → allowed automatically
High risk (writes financial data, external inputs) → blocked until human approval
```

Risk scoring uses the compiled authority map to determine what authority AI-generated
code would gain.

## Unified Authority Pipeline

LogicN models authority as a pipeline from source to observable execution:

```text
source code
  -> compiler proof
  -> execution plan
  -> runtime authority checks
  -> governed effects
  -> observable audit trail
```

Compile time and runtime authority cooperate — they are not in conflict:

```text
Compile time proves intent.
Runtime governs effects.
```

## Boundary Authority

Boundaries are where compile-time certainty weakens. External inputs from HTTP,
queues, files, AI responses, and plugins cannot be trusted automatically:

```logicn
let body: Json unsafe unvalidated = boundary.api.body(request)
```

Compile time knows: this value came from outside authority.

Validation restores trust:

```logicn
let customer: Customer safe validated = validate.customer(body)
```

```text
Boundaries degrade authority.
Validation restores authority.
```

## Compile-Time Proof vs Runtime Truth

Compile-time proof does not guarantee runtime truth.

```logicn
flow fetchOrders() -> Result<Array<Order>, ApiError>
effects [network.outbound] {
  ...
}
```

Compile time proves:
- The flow declared outbound network usage
- The return type is `Result<Array<Order>, ApiError>`

Runtime still determines:
- DNS resolution, TLS success, rate limits, credential validity, API availability

**Runtime denial is not a failure of the type system.** It is correct layered authority.

Example:
```text
Compiler says: Flow declaration is valid.
Runtime says:  Outbound export denied by policy.
```

That is the correct outcome — compile-time approval does not imply runtime permission.

## Authority as Contracts

LogicN declarations are authority contracts:

```logicn
secure flow createCustomer(input: CustomerInput)
  -> Result<Customer, ApiError>
  effects [database.write, audit.log]
{
  ...
}
```

This tells the **compiler**:
- Required input shape
- Required effects
- Possible outcomes
- Security-sensitive execution

This tells the **runtime**:
- This flow needs database write access
- This flow writes audit events
- This flow may contain sensitive handling

The runtime can prepare execution policy before running the flow.

## Runtime Authority is Observable

```text
Flow: createCustomer
Declared effects:
  database.write
  audit.log

Granted at runtime:
  database.write = allowed
  audit.log      = allowed
  network.outbound = denied
```

This is useful for security review, AI planning, compliance, sandboxing,
and runtime debugging.

## Type Manifest Connection

The generated type manifest bridges compile-time and runtime authority:

```json
{
  "types":       ["Customer", "Order", "PaymentStatus"],
  "effects":     ["database.write", "audit.log"],
  "boundaries":  ["CreateOrderRequest"],
  "runtimeModes": ["Checked"]
}
```

Runtime uses it to:
- Prepare validation and decoders
- Prepare effect policies
- Prepare execution plans
- Prepare observability

The manifest is a runtime governance asset, not just metadata.

## LogicN vs Traditional Languages

Traditional languages:
```text
compiler checks syntax and types
runtime executes instructions
```

LogicN:
```text
compiler proves governance contracts
runtime coordinates governed execution
```

## Core Principle

```text
Compile-time authority tells the compiler what a flow needs.
Runtime authority verifies the actor and environment before execution.

Authority never propagates implicitly.
fn has no authority.
Each flow declares its own authority explicitly.

Compile time proves intent.
Runtime governs effects.
Boundaries degrade authority.
Validation restores authority.
```
