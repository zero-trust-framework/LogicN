# Governed Event-Driven Execution

## Status

Status: Future — This feature is not yet implemented in Stage A (Phase 1-15).
Planned for: Stage B

## Definition

LogicN supports event-driven execution but is not a purely event-driven system. It is a **governed execution runtime** that supports event-driven workloads safely.

```text
Events may trigger execution.
They must never hide execution.
```

## The Problem with Pure Event-Driven

Traditional event-driven systems:

```text
event A -> triggers B -> triggers C -> triggers D
```

Problems:

```text
hidden execution chains
difficult auditing
unclear authority
difficult debugging
uncontrolled retries
invisible compute cost
runaway event loops
```

These conflict with LogicN's security, auditability, governance, and AI-readable architecture goals.

## LogicN Execution Model

Events are one of several input types. All inputs follow the same governed path:

```text
Request/Event
 -> Intake Guard
 -> Authority Control
 -> Execution Classification
 -> Governed Execution Plan
 -> Runtime Logistics
 -> Resource Deployment
 -> Execution Coordination
 -> Result Assembly
 -> Response Gate
 -> Audit Proof
```

## What LogicN Supports

```text
asynchronous work
queues
streams
jobs
webhooks
deferred processing
parallel workloads
distributed execution
```

These improve throughput, scalability, latency, and hardware utilisation — when governed.

## Critical Path vs Deferred Events

### Critical Path (synchronous)

Must complete immediately:

```text
authentication
payment authorization
permission checks
response generation
```

### Deferred Event Path (async)

Can execute later:

```text
thumbnail generation
search indexing
AI tagging
notifications
analytics
report generation
```

## Event Declaration

All events must be typed, permissioned, budgeted, traceable, auditable, schedulable, and bounded:

```logicn
event ImageUploaded {
  input: Image.uploaded

  permission use image_process

  budget {
    time: 5s
    memory: 128mb
    retries: 3
  }

  flow generateThumbnail
}
```

## Event Runtime Processing

```text
1. validate event contract
2. verify permission
3. assign execution budget
4. classify compute requirements
5. deploy to correct hardware
6. audit execution
7. validate output
```

## Event Governance Rules

| Rule | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Events must be typed | Named, structured, not anonymous messages |
| Events must be permissioned | Cannot bypass authority control |
| Events must have budgets | Time, memory, retry limits declared |
| Events must be auditable | Actor, source, triggered flow, result recorded |
| Events must be traceable | Event chain lineage maintained to avoid invisible paths |

## Recommended Runtime Direction

```text
Plan-driven governance core
+ Governed event execution
+ Partially asynchronous runtime coordination
```

This combines: security, speed, concurrency, auditability, hardware orchestration, AI-native execution.

## Final Principle

```text
Plan first.
Govern always.
Run events only when declared.
```

```text
LogicN supports event-driven execution,
but all events must remain governed,
permissioned, auditable and coordinated by the runtime.
```
