# R&D Absorption Catalog — the complete ledger

**LogicN is the single "main library."** Every durable knowledge doc from the R&D repo
(`C:\wwwprojects\LogicN-R-AND-D`) is accounted for here so nothing is silently missing. Built from a 49-doc
classification sweep (2026-06-17), pinned to R&D commit **`fb68d06`**. The standing import rule is the memory
`feedback-auto-import-rd-docs`; re-run it whenever R&D changes.

## How absorption works (the four dispositions)
- **vendored** → format **specs** copied into the engine package `packages-logicn/logicn-ext-tmf/spec/` (provenance pin in that folder's `PROVENANCE` note). These ARE the implementation contract.
- **mirrored** → durable research/strategy/findings copied **verbatim** into `docs/Knowledge-Bases/rd-absorbed/rd-*.md` with a provenance header. That subfolder is intentionally **not** scanned by `kb-graph` (scanner is non-recursive) so the mirrors carry their upstream-relative links without polluting the graph. They are still in the repo = in the library.
- **curated** → high-value strategic content rewritten as a flat first-class KB doc (graph-indexed): `logicn-quantum-resilience-roadmap.md`, and the pre-existing `logicn-*` docs listed under "native view".
- **catalog_only** → process/status/duplicate/superseded/gated docs that should NOT be imported as their own doc; their genuinely KB-absent facts are captured in **Appendix A** below.

> R&D remains **upstream/authoring**. Edit the source there, then re-vendor/re-mirror here. Do **not** fork the copies.

## 1. Specs — vendored into `logicn-ext-tmf/spec/`
`tmx-256-construction-v0` · `tmf-container-v0` · `tmf-modalities-v0` · `tmf-encryption-v0` · `signature-custody-v0` · `threshold-custody-v0` · `inclusion-proof-v0` · `tmf-history-chain-v0` · `governed-trust-capsule-v0` · `nvfp4-codec-v0`. Curated view: `logicn-tmf-engine.md`. The golden generators `tmf/spec/_vectors/*.py` stay upstream as the authoring oracle (binding conformance = the in-package golden tests).

Process/scratch deliberately **not** cataloged: `_session-bridge/*`, `*/notes/*` duplicates (`tri-encription/notes/1-3` == `tmf/notes/1-3`), probe `*.lln`, `spec/_vectors/*`, vendored `node_modules`.

## Appendix A — durable facts captured from non-mirrored docs
Facts genuinely absent elsewhere in the KB, preserved here so the library is complete.

**Measured crypto benchmark** (from `tri-encription/bench/README.md`; i9-9900K, Node v24.16.0, `@noble` 0.6.1 pure-JS, single-thread):
- ML-KEM-768 keygen/encaps/decaps **2,498 / 2,123 / 1,719 ops/s**; hybrid X25519+ML-KEM-768 606/237/285; ML-DSA-65 keygen/sign/verify **545 / 114 / 505 ops/s**.
- Hashes (pure-JS): SHA-256 210 MB/s; SHA3-256/SHAKE256 26 MB/s; AES-256-GCM 38 MB/s; TMX-256 full 21 MB/s; Reed-Solomon GF(256) k=10 m=4 encode/recover 159/248 MB/s.
- **Native (node:crypto/OpenSSL):** SHA-256 614 MB/s; SHAKE256 ≈0.81× SHA-256 (498 MB/s — choosing the XOF costs ~nothing on real HW); AES-256-GCM (AES-NI) **1,112–1,273 MB/s** (~34× the pure-JS floor); ChaCha20-Poly1305 pure-JS 182 MB/s (the no-AES-NI alt).
- **Per-64 KiB `.tmf` section round-trip** (seal→TMX root→sign→verify-before-decrypt→open): L3 (hybrid-768 + ML-DSA-65) **~27 ms**; L5 (hybrid-1024+P-384 + ML-DSA-87) ~43 ms; L5 + {ML-DSA-87, SLH-DSA-256s} AND **~5,265 ms** (SLH-DSA *signing* dominates; its verify ~13 ms so receivers are unaffected); receiver verify+open ~10–27 ms.
- **Read:** PQ KEM is not a speed problem (cost is ciphertext size 1088/1568 B); the real costs are signature *size* and SLH-DSA-256s *signing* latency (~5 s, cold-path only); AEAD is never the bottleneck.

**Golden-file facts** (from `tmf/research/findings-and-next-intentions.md`): container golden = **203 bytes**; passed **17 tamper + 11 bounds** fail-closed cases; NVFP4 golden block bytes `38a150413f00000000`. NVFP4 E2M1 has 8 explicit magnitudes {0,½,1,1½,2,3,4,6} (not 3 ternary states); there is a second-level per-tensor FP32 `global_scale` above the 1-byte E4M3 per-block scale; the idealized IEEE decode is wrong for the 0/0.5 subnormals (use the fixed value table).

**ffsim grounding** (from `FFSM/_raw-miner-findings.md`): 1-D Fermi-Hubbard norb=2 half-filling ground-state eigenvalue = **−6.000000000000** (exact, smallest golden); H2/STO-6G linear-method VQE `result.fun` = −0.970773. **Jordan-Wigner is provably non-bit-deterministic** (`par_iter().fold().reduce()` merges thread-local HashMaps in nondeterministic order → Pauli-coeff sums reassociate; tol cutoff can flip near-threshold terms) — the concrete proof that the bridge's `determinismMode` must be **tolerance, not exact**. Thread partitioning is host-dependent unless `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` is pinned.

**Other:** RFC 9964 (May 2026) specifics — COSE-ML-DSA: ML-DSA-65 = COSE alg `-49`, EMPTY ctx, signs the COSE `Sig_structure`; Trust Capsule moved domain separation into the signed `body_protected` `surface` label + `external_aad`. NIST **SP 800-226** grounds the privacy declassifier's `aggregate` label (DP ≠ anonymization; GDPR Art 5(1)(b)+89). GAP-4: `for…in` runs in the interpreter but the WASM wat-emitter has no `forEachStmt` case (emits a no-op stub) → roadmap **#128** (fail-loud). MeshQL/TUFC/Virtio-Trit/systolic-array transport (notes 1–3) remain **gated R&D-only** (not LogicN governance knowledge).
