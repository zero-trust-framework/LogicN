# LogicN — R&D Results Log (quick-lookup verdict table)

**Purpose.** One-glance lookup of *what R&D concluded and why* — **positive AND negative**. A REFUTED idea is as
valuable as an adopted one: recording *why we did not adopt* stops it being re-proposed (the corpus repeatedly finds
~80% of "new" ideas re-derive shipped architecture). **Standing process (owner 2026-06-23):** when an R&D job comes
back (`_session-bridge/done/NNNN-*.done.md`), the hub absorbs it into the KB and **adds a row here** — adopted or
refuted, with the reason — then refreshes the KB index. See [[feedback-rd-absorb-positive-and-negative]].

**Verdict legend:** ✅ ADOPTED (built/shipped) · 🧪 DESIGNED (KB design, build pending) · 🔭 TRACKED (track-not-build)
· ❌ REFUTED (not adopted + reason) · ⏳ PENDING (dispatched, awaiting `done/`) · 🔒 GATED (owner/HW/infra-gated).

> Full doc-level absorption history is in [logicn-rd-absorption-catalog.md](logicn-rd-absorption-catalog.md); per-cluster
> disposition tables (every finding, both directions) live in e.g. [logicn-transport-auth-research-explained-2026-06-22.md](logicn-transport-auth-research-explained-2026-06-22.md).
> This log is the *quick-lookup verdict roll-up* across them.

## Adopted / Designed (recent)

No "guessing" — deterministic, unknown→0→keep | [compiler-intelligence](logicn-compiler-intelligence-deterministic-foresight.md) (wf `w2gzcbx9d`) |
| Photonic auto-promotion WITHOUT explicit authorization | ❌ REFUTED | violates "no hidden power/cost" + determinism contract; precision/crypto→photonic "must stay impossible" — agency is BOUNDED (explicit `substrate{}` envelope + auto-route within, fail-closed to Binary) | compiler-intelligence §3 |
| Module-wide `contract.invariant{}` (note 45 Part 1) | 🧪 DESIGNED | promote flow-`invariant{}` → module-wide, injected into every flow; **tier by provability** (static-proof / block-build · injected DbC `ensure` · alias-to-`limits`); AI-drift immunity (invariant lives at the contract layer, not the body an AI edits) | [invariant module-wide R&D](logicn-contract-invariant-module-wide-rd.md) |
| Bitnet bridge Standard-2 governance gate (R&D 0086, owner-forwarded) | ✅ ADOPTED / BUILT | wired the `canCommit()` PREFLIGHT on the native path of BOTH cpu+gpu bridges, fail-closed (denied COMMIT throws, native addon not called); closed a doc-vs-code unwired-control gap; +3 tests (13→16 green).

| Compiler-enforced affine authority + type-state pipeline (R&D 0087, from notes/46) | 🧪 DESIGNED — ADOPT, build owner-gated | BUNDLE all 5 compile-time tightenings on the shared value-state pass (affine/move-once authority · Raw→Verified→Authorized→Sealed type-state · run-scope lifetimes · must-use→compile-error · newtype hashes); **GATE item 1 (affine) on explicit owner GO** first.

| notes/51 — NumPy→TS: full numeric/ndarray/linalg in core? | ❌ REFUTED (by design) | Full NumPy parity in core = NO by design; core governs numeric SHAPES (core-vector types), compute behind ext-bridge-cpp/-bitnet; `for x in xs where c` = the shipped `np.where` analog; ndarray/broadcasting REFUTE; dense linalg (inv/det/eig) = TRACK behind a future Toxic-Border ext-bridge on real demand | core-vector/src/index.ts · ext-bridge-cpp/src/index.ts |

## Refuted — and WHY we did not adopt (the negative record)
| Idea | Verdict | Why refuted |
|---|---|---|
| Photonic SHA-256 / any crypto-on-photonic | ❌ REFUTED | crypto/keys stay Binary by invariant; analog can't be a key (No-Coercion); photonic = degrade-only operand only |
| Photonic state as a signature/auth byte | ❌ REFUTED | PAC-learnable optical state; crypto-on-core violation → demoted to a degrade-only K3 tamper signal *under* the digital Ed25519+ML-DSA-65 sig |
| Ternary Ephemeral Ratchet (analog `E_ternary` in the KDF) | ❌ REFUTED | hard crypto-on-core violation |
| Continuous float trust `T_c` as the gate | ❌ REFUTED | conflicts with discrete fail-closed K3 → telemetry-only, discretized via `vAnd` |
| TMX-256 / ML-DSA TritMesh stack for LogicN | ❌ REFUTED | keep SHA-256 (Grover→128-bit OK) + ML-DSA-65; no benefit to swapping |
| Z3/SMT proof for the cert-gate K3 algebra | ❌ REFUTED (2026-06-23) | a 4-factor `min` is already exhaustively tested by the 3⁴ truth table; Z3 belongs on tri-tier i32 conformance instead |
| Tri-logic "speeds up" JSON parsing | ❌ REFUTED | category error (K3 is governance, not parsing); the real win is a simdjson branchless classifier |
| Photonic tensor-precompute = O(1) | ❌ REFUTED | classic precompute trade (apply still O(N²); dense T_reach mem; fusion densifies 39×) — not O(1) |
| Cleartext semantic routing across a trust boundary | ❌ KILLED | LLN-PRIVACY-002 blocks cleartext semantic embeddings at network sinks |
| `contract.invariant` "Auto self-healing immune system" (note 45 Part 2) | ❌ REFUTED | (1) loosen-on-low-risk = FAIL-OPEN (spoof telemetry → loosened net); invariants must be monotonic-tighten-only (`LLN-MONO`); (2) synthesise conditions from analog HIV telemetry = No-Coercion violation + guessing; (3) host-side `LogicNAutoInvariantEngine` misplaces trust (host is hostile; enforcer must be in-DSS.wasm). Sound core re-derives the shipped monotonic emergency overlay | [invariant module-wide R&D](logicn-contract-invariant-module-wide-rd.md) |
