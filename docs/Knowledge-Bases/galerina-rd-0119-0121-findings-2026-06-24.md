# R&D 0119 / 0120 / 0121 — discovery, architecture-gap, and tooling-adequacy findings (2026-06-24)

Three adversarially-verified Ultracode sweeps. This consolidates the actionable backlog so nothing is lost. Posture: most-secure zero-trust choice; honest, no manufactured work.

## RD-0119 — Unlock + small-wins discovery (`w4b5597yv`)

**THE UNLOCK:** `@noble/post-quantum@0.6.1` (FIPS 203/204/205, ML-DSA-65) is **already installed + tested** in core-compiler/tower-citizen — `ml_dsa65.verify` runs at `attestation.ts:315-318` (23/23). The "blocked on a vetted FIPS-204 lib" label was **stale**.
- **`RD-0119-O1` `.tmf` slice-4 verify-before-read** → **buildable now, NOT #34-gated** (verify is public-key math). Today `container.ts:160-163` rejects all signed `.tmf`; adding verify is **fail-closed-preserving**. MUST resolve the pubkey via the **trusted registry + revocation** (not the file's embedded key = TOFU fail-open) + ctx `tmf-root-v0`. **OWNER-GREENLIGHT** (enable signed-.tmf admission?).
- Hybrid SIGNING (0043) is **already shipped** (stale-done); only the owner's #34 air-gapped ceremony remains. **TRACK**.
- **4 XS truth-fixes → SHIPPED this run** (`7eb2a89`): target-js PLANNED-NOT-ENFORCED banner, wat-emitter `rem_s` false-trap comment, gen-tests doc-drift, + the handover 0008-tmf-verify relabel.
- **0016 generator** is **partially shipped** (not 0%): `test-generator.ts` + `galerina generate tests` ship (command renamed from `gen-tests` per the owner's 0016 reconciliation — old spelling now redirects); residual = file-emission (`--out`) + runnable assertions + CI regenerate-and-diff. **OWNER-GREENLIGHT** (MEDIUM feature, not security).
- **Cross-compare `RD-0119-X1`** (strongest): the emitter's `flowHandlesSecrets` (`wat-emitter.ts:269`) re-derives a **weaker, shallow** secret-detector than the sound propagating taint at `value-state-checker.ts:412` — a derived-secret/helper flow reads `false` so **neither** zeroing path fires (true fail-quiet). Three consumers (0055 zeroing, 0118 storage-sink, VSC egress) want the same "transitively secret-derived" bit. Lift it into one shared fact (monotone-broadening = fail-safe, independent of the risky #70 transform). **OWNER-GREENLIGHT** (first slice = a never-silent "excluded-from-zeroing" diagnostic + the taint-lift).

## RD-0120 — Missing software-architecture (`wvc1efjl1`)

**6 BUILD-NOW, 8 owner-greenlight, 5 track.** The BUILD-NOW set:
- **`RD-0120-F1` governedFlowDecl taint fail-open → ✅ FIXED this run** (`45f4816`). A 5th parsed flow-kind (`governed floor_N flow`) the value-state checker had **0** references to → governed-flow tainted params reached sinks silently (the 0093 class). Now registers params + boundary-untrusted; 3/3 regression tests.
- **`RD-0120-F2` deadline enforcement reads-as-enforced** (worse-than-absent): `checkDeadline()` is polled at only 4 interpreter sites; an in-flight bridge/builtin call is awaited with **no timeout** (uninterruptible). `FUNGI-RUNTIME-006` advertises `request_time > limit` as enforced. **BUILD-NOW interim:** a poll-at-every-bridge-boundary lint (only *adds* abort points) + honest doc; full fuel-counter preemption overlaps WASM #103/#104 (owner follow-on).
- **`RD-0120-F3` no SBOM → ✅ FIXED this run** (`b79201b`). `generateCycloneDxSbom` (sbom.ts) emits a CycloneDX 1.5 BOM from the resolver fields, fail-closed (a component without a valid sha256 → UNVERIFIED + FUNGI-SBOM-001 + complete:false); deterministic; governance footprint as properties. 6/6 tests. (Signed-SBOM still rides the #34/#67 gates.)
- **`RD-0120-F4` observability producer → ✅ FIXED this run** (`3e19a51`). `buildGovernanceSnapshot` (exposition.ts) projects raw runtime state into a fail-closed snapshot (mask decode + effect→family + tier/status allow-list; drops unsafe labels) — a host wires `renderPrometheus(buildGovernanceSnapshot(state))`. 7/7 tests. Host-side state extraction remains the thin follow-up.
- **`RD-0120-F5` circuit_breaker posture-trip is a no-op → ✅ FIXED this run** (`a3a827f`). Parsed-but-inert (DRCM Phase 5); now fails LOUD via `FUNGI-RES-CB-PENDING` (warning) so a declared-but-inert safety control never reads as enforced. +2 tests, suite 114/114.
- **`RD-0120-F6` SECURITY.md disclosure-contact placeholder** (`<SET SECURITY CONTACT BEFORE PUBLISHING>`, line 33). XS — **owner provides the contact**.

**OWNER-GREENLIGHT:** SLSA/sigstore toolchain provenance ("verify everything except the verifier"); CI dependency-tree integrity (`npm ci`/audit; 6 caret-ranged crypto/WASM deps); audit-log **record-level** tamper-evidence (`prevHash`/`seq` — chain primitives exist twice, pick the consolidation); data-retention enforcement (`lineage{retention}` parsed, read by nothing); reproducible-build cross-process + CI.
**TRACK (gated/structural):** runtime process/memory isolation (#102-106, honestly documented as SIMULATED); mid-execution capability revocation; idempotency/exactly-once; continuous parser fuzzing; LSP.

## RD-0121 — Are graphs / tests / dev-tools still adequate? (`ws0znezws`)

- **GRAPHS — adequate-with-gaps (closer to inadequate for *security* use).** The graph *library* is rich (topoSort/detectCycle/BoundaryGraph/blast-radius) and tier-boundary CI is mature — but the CLI `graph` command **imports only `GraphBuilder`+`bfsPath`** and runs **no cycle detection, no structural validation**; "no cycles flagged" = not checked. And the dep graph is near-empty: **39 `depends_on` edges across 91 packages** (text co-occurrence, not a real DAG — a brittle name-transform silently drops deps). **BUILD-NOW:** wire `validateProjectGraph` + `topoSort` into `graph --check` (exit non-zero on cycle/dangling); resolve real `package.json` name→spec deps; a build-free CI regenerate-and-diff with a provenance sidecar.
- **TESTS — adequate-with-gaps (deep where it counts; breadth/automation gaps).** The mutation gate (17/17) + i32 fidelity-differential are mature. But: **the full suite is NOT CI-enforced** — only `source-hygiene-no-nul.test.mjs` runs in CI; the 360-file suite + mutation `--full` + fidelity can regress locally unnoticed (**the single highest-leverage gap**). **Float/i64 cross-tier fidelity is UNTESTED** (corpus all-Int) — a latent walker-vs-WASM divergence (NaN/−0/rounding/i64) passes green. **No code coverage** measured or gated anywhere. **BUILD-NOW:** `test.yml` enforcing the full suite + mutation `--full`; extend the differential to Float+i64 (and most-secure interim: WASM emitter **refuses** to lower float/i64 to the fast tier until proven equivalent — force walker reference); wire `--experimental-test-coverage` with a ratcheting floor.
- **OTHER DEV TOOLS — adequate-with-gaps.** lint-conventions runs `--soft` (291 report-only baselines) — the path to enforcing is real but un-walked; no formatter, no Dependabot/Renovate, no SBOM. (Overlaps RD-0120 supply-chain.)

## The genuine OWNER DECISIONS (distilled)

1. **Full-suite CI enforcement** (RD-0121 #1 + RD-0120 mutation-not-in-CI) — the highest-leverage gap; everything else can silently regress without it. Build `test.yml` enforcing? *(infra: the non-workspace monorepo needs per-package installs.)*
2. **`.tmf` slice-4 verify unlock** (RD-0119-O1) — build it the secure way (registry-resolved pubkeys + revocation, fail-closed, `tmf-root-v0`)? Enables signed-.tmf admission.
3. **The shared secret-taint lift** (RD-0119-X1 / RD-0120 + 0055) — greenlight the no-risk slice (sound-taint detection + never-silent excluded-from-zeroing diagnostic)?
4. **Float/i64 cross-tier fidelity** (RD-0121) — extend the differential, and have the emitter refuse-to-lower until proven (fail-closed)?

The remaining BUILD-NOW items (deadline-boundary lint, SBOM emit, observability producer, circuit-breaker fail-loud, graph `--check`) are clean+bounded — I can ship them under full-auto as the most-secure choice; the four above are the genuine forks.
