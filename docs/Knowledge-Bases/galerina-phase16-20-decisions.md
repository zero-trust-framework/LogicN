# Galerina Phase 16–20 Design Decisions

## Status

```
Recorded: 2026-05-31
Applies to: Phase 16-20 + Stage B/C definitions
```

## Decision 1 — Stage B Complete Definition

```text
Stage B Complete = Medium
```

**One-line definition:**
"Stage B is complete when the Galerina-native compiler can lex, parse, build an AST, resolve imports, and perform semantic/type analysis on real Galerina programs without relying on TypeScript compiler logic."

**Required for Stage B Complete:**
```
lexer.spore            ← Stage B1 (partially done)
parser.spore           ← Stage B1 (v0 done)
ast.spore              ← Stage B2
importResolver.spore   ← Stage B2
typeChecker.spore      ← Stage B2
effectChecker.spore    ← Stage B2
```

**NOT required for Stage B Complete:**
- Full code generation
- Deterministic bootstrap
- TypeScript removal

Those are Stage C concerns.

**Stage B sub-milestones:**
```
Stage B1 — Parsing
  lexer.spore + parser.spore can parse real Galerina

Stage B2 — Semantic Analysis
  typeChecker.spore + effectChecker.spore can validate real Galerina

Stage B3 — Self-Hosted Front End
  Source → Galerina Compiler → Diagnostics (no TypeScript compiler logic)

Stage B Complete
```

**Stage C — Bootstrap Independence:**
```
Galerina Compiler compiles Galerina Compiler
Deterministic self-host verification (B1 == B2 == B3)
Root capability provider enforced
TypeScript compiler dependency removed
```

---

## Decision 2 — Package System: Both registry and manifests

```
Built-in @galerinaa/* packages → internal registry (hardcoded, fast)
User/workspace packages     → package.galerina.yaml manifests
```

**Resolution order:**
1. Built-in registry (for `@galerinaa/*` certified packages)
2. Workspace `package.galerina.yaml`
3. Local package path
4. Later: certified remote registry

**Minimal manifest shape:**
```yaml
name: "@myorg/customer-types"
version: "0.1.0"
exports:
  types:
    - CustomerId
    - Customer
    - Email
effects: []
capabilities: []
```

**Rule:** Do NOT expand the hardcoded registry as the general package system.
The registry is for known certified Galerina packages. Everything else uses manifests.

## Decision 3 — executePlan() scope: all flows eventually

**End state:** All flows use `executePlan()`. No two runtimes.

**Phase 16 scope (start with):**
- Secure flows → GovernedPlan
- Guarded flows → GovernedPlan
- Simple pure flows → PurePlan

**Plan types:**
```
PurePlan:
  constants, local lets, arithmetic, pure fn calls, return

GovernedPlan:
  effects, capabilities, audit events, denied behaviours, runtime checks
```

Both executed by the same `executePlan()` engine.

**Why not secure/guarded only?**
Two runtimes (AST-walked + plan-based) become permanent technical debt.
One engine, two plan complexities — is the correct architecture.

**One-line rule:**
"Phase 16 replaces AST-walking for all flow kinds, beginning with a minimal PurePlan and expanding toward full governed execution plans."

---

## Decision 4 — Roadmap granularity: Phase numbers + milestone names

```
Phase 16 — Passive Execution Plans
Phase 17 — Package System & Import Resolution
Phase 18 — AI Semantic Graph
Phase 19 — Compiler Governance
Phase 20 — Stage B Completion
```

Benefits:
- Phase numbers: progress tracking, issue grouping, release planning
- Milestone names: readability, meaning, developer memory

Rule: developers remember "Semantic Graph milestone", not "Phase 18". Use both.

---

## Summary

```
Stage B Complete    = Medium (lexer + parser + type checker + effect checker self-hosted)
Package System      = Both (registry for @galerinaa/*, manifests for user packages)
executePlan() scope = All flows (PurePlan for pure, GovernedPlan for governed)
Roadmap format      = Phase numbers + milestone names
```
