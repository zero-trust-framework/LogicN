# AI Self-Modification Governance

## Purpose

LogicN should not design for "self-aware AI" as a special authority class.

LogicN should design for AI that can write, test and propose code, but cannot
silently gain authority.

Core rule:

```text
AI may generate code.
AI may not grant itself permission.
AI may not bypass review.
AI may not change its own boundary.
```

The safest model is:

```text
AI is a contributor, not an owner.
```

## Authority Principle

An AI should never directly own the authority needed to expand its own
authority.

The critical distinction is:

```text
desire != authority
```

An AI may request more capability, but the request must pass through governance
layers before authority is issued.

The AI reasoning system and the authority system must be separate:

```text
AI core:
  reasoning
  planning
  code generation
  self-analysis
  optimisation proposals

authority kernel:
  capabilities
  effect permissions
  storage access
  network access
  compute access
  model spawning
  policy approval
  audit integrity
```

The AI core may express intent. The authority kernel decides whether authority
can be leased.

## AI Boundary

AI/tool execution is a first-class runtime boundary:

```text
boundary = package + storage + external + event + AI/tool + compute
```

AI-generated code and AI tool calls must declare:

```text
can_read: docs/*
can_write: generated/*
can_call: test_runner
cannot_call: shell
cannot_read: secrets/*
```

If an AI-generated program does not declare an effect, it cannot use that
effect.

Read and write authority must be separate. Reading code, writing generated
files, changing package manifests, installing dependencies, running tests,
calling shell commands and editing policy must be different capabilities.

## Human Approval Gates

AI may propose:

- code changes
- migrations
- package installs
- policy changes
- deployment changes
- capability changes

High-risk changes require human or external policy approval.

Approval is required by default for changes to:

- compiler core
- security policy engine
- permission model
- capability checker
- audit system
- cryptographic trust roots
- package signing policy
- production deployment policy

AI-authored changes cannot be promoted unless:

- type checks pass
- policy checks pass
- effect checks pass
- package/dependency checks pass
- tests pass in a sandbox
- an audit report is produced
- the required approval gate passes

## AI-Generated Code Quarantine

AI-generated code should enter quarantine before it can become trusted code.

Flow:

```text
AI writes code
 -> store in quarantine
 -> compiler checks syntax and types
 -> effect checker extracts requested powers
 -> policy checker evaluates authority
 -> tests run in sandbox
 -> audit report generated
 -> human/policy approval
 -> promote to trusted package or app code
```

Quarantine output must be reproducible, reviewable, testable and auditable.

AI-generated code may edit ordinary application code only inside declared
boundaries. It must not edit the compiler core, security policy engine,
permission model, audit system, capability checker or cryptographic trust roots
unless special governance allows that change.

## Immutable Audit Log

Every AI-authored action should record:

- prompt/input
- generated code
- requested permissions
- granted permissions
- files changed
- package installs requested
- policy changes requested
- tests run
- reviewer or approval policy
- result

The audit log must not be editable by the AI actor being audited.

Audit integrity is part of the authority model. A change that disables,
rewrites or hides its own audit trail must fail closed.

## Capability Lease Model

LogicN should treat capability as an approved lease of authority, not permanent
possession.

Example:

```text
can_read: docs/*
expires: 10 minutes
scope: project_x
audit: required
```

Rejected form:

```text
global_admin_forever = true
```

Capability leases should include:

```text
actor
scope
requested capability
granted capability
expiry
approver chain
risk score
revocation handle
audit event
```

If AI wants more authority, the runtime should require:

1. declaration
2. justification
3. policy evaluation
4. risk scoring
5. sandbox simulation where appropriate
6. external approval
7. revocable issuance
8. audit trail

## Capability Attenuation

Every delegation must preserve or reduce authority.

Example:

```text
Human admin
  -> grants AI read-only docs access

AI
  -> may delegate only narrower read-only docs access
```

The AI may not delegate broader authority than it received.

## Separation Of Duties

Future AI systems should be split into governed roles:

```text
planner   cannot execute code
coder     cannot deploy
deployer  cannot change policy
auditor   cannot write production code
```

Even if one agent fails or behaves badly, it should not hold enough authority to
escape all governance boundaries.

This also prevents hidden "god mode" agent roles. No single agent should hold
planning, code writing, deployment, policy approval and audit authority at the
same time.

## Constitutional Runtime Rule

LogicN should support a runtime governance invariant:

```text
No process may grant itself broader authority than the authority already
possessed by its approver chain.
```

Authority must be declared, observable, attributable, revocable, auditable and
externally governable.

Some trust roots should be immutable to runtime AI:

- compiler trust root
- security policy engine root
- capability validator root
- audit integrity root
- package signing root
- cryptographic trust root

Runtime AI may propose changes to these roots, but the proposal must go through
external governance and cannot be self-approved.

## Disallowed Patterns

AI must not:

- grant capabilities to itself
- self-approve policy changes
- bypass type checks
- bypass effect checks
- bypass audit
- bypass package checks
- read secrets by default
- install packages dynamically without approval
- access shell by default
- silently access network
- edit its own boundary
- modify trust roots without governance
- create more powerful agents than itself

No "god mode" agent role should exist.

## Package And Dependency Rules

AI must not import arbitrary packages or install dependencies without declared
policy. Package installation, package upgrade, plugin activation and tool
registration should require:

- declared reason
- package identity
- signature or checksum where available
- requested effects
- requested capabilities
- dependency risk report
- approval decision
- audit record

Signed or locked packages are preferred for trusted promotion.

## Runtime Reports

AI self-modification and authority requests should appear in:

```text
ai-authority-request-report.json
ai-code-quarantine-report.json
ai-approval-report.json
ai-audit-report.json
capability-lease-report.json
agent-security-report.json
```

Reports should show requested authority, granted authority, approver chain,
lease expiry, changed files, tests, policy results and audit status.

Security reports should also show:

- denied self-grant attempts
- denied boundary edits
- denied trust-root edits
- denied package installs
- approval gate decisions
- quarantine promotion status
- revoked capability leases

## Final Principle

The dangerous part is not intelligence.

The dangerous part is uncontrolled authority.

LogicN's safest AI rule is:

```text
AI may contribute.
AI may not own its own authority.
```
