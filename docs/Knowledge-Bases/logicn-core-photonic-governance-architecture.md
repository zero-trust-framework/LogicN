# LogicN Core Photonic — Governance Architecture

Version: v0.2 Governance Overlay
Status: Draft Governance Specification
Applies To: `logicn-core-photonic`
Depends On: `logicn-core-photonic-v02.md`
Supersedes: Prior governance assumptions in `logicn-core-photonic-backend-architecture.md`

See also: `logicn-core-photonic-v02.md`, `logicn-core-photonic-backend-architecture.md`.

Note on `OpticalTransportMode` conflict: This governance spec defines a six-value
enum with values DIRECT/WAVELENGTH/PACKETIZED/HYBRID/EMULATED/SIMULATED.
The `logicn-core-photonic-v02.md` formal spec uses Waveguide/Coherent/Mesh/
FreeSpace/Hybrid/Experimental. Both define 6 values but with different names
and semantics. This conflict must be resolved before implementation.

---

## 1. Purpose

The governance layer establishes:
- deterministic execution guarantees
- transport-mode compliance enforcement
- topology validation
- execution capability negotiation
- runtime authorization
- deployment integrity
- policy enforcement
- auditability
- compatibility governance
- specification evolution controls

Aligns with: `OpticalTransportMode` six-value enum, `PhotonicRuntimeTarget` v0.2,
`PhotonicExecutionPlan` v0.2, `PhotonicCapability` definitions, topology constraints,
validation functions, deterministic execution requirements, LLN-PHOTONIC-001–006.

---

## 2. Governance Objectives

| Objective | Description |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Determinism | Identical execution plans produce identical outcomes under equivalent runtime conditions |
| Safety | Unsupported photonic configurations are rejected before execution |
| Compatibility | Runtime targets remain version-governed and capability compatible |
| Auditability | Every execution decision is reconstructable from governance logs |
| Composability | Transport and topology rules compose without ambiguity |
| Evolvability | Future transport and topology extensions remain backward-governable |
| Isolation | Runtime capability exposure is explicitly bounded |
| Verification | All plans are validated before activation |

---

## 3. Governance Layers

The governance architecture is divided into seven coordinated layers.

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 7. Audit & Trace Governance         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 6. Policy Enforcement Governance    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 5. Runtime Capability Governance    │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Execution Plan Governance        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Topology Governance              │

│ 2. Transport Governance             │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 1. Specification Governance         │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer MUST be independently verifiable.

---

## 4. Specification Governance

### 4.1 Version Authority

The photonic governance system SHALL treat the v0.2 specification as the
authoritative semantic model.

Governed entities: transport modes, topology definitions, runtime targets,
execution plans, capability descriptors, validation functions, deterministic
execution semantics.

### 4.2 Semantic Versioning Rules

| Change Type | Governance Requirement |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Patch | MUST NOT alter execution semantics |
| Minor | MAY introduce additive capabilities |
| Major | MAY redefine transport or topology behavior |

### 4.3 Compatibility Enforcement

A runtime target MUST declare:
- supported specification version
- supported transport modes
- supported topology families
- deterministic execution compliance
- validation capability set

Execution MUST fail if specification versions are incompatible, required
transport modes are unsupported, or topology compatibility cannot be guaranteed.

### 4.4 Determinism Governance Rule

A photonic execution MUST:
1. produce stable execution ordering
2. preserve topology consistency
3. prevent nondeterministic transport negotiation
4. prohibit ambiguous capability selection
5. prohibit implicit runtime mutation

Any runtime violating deterministic guarantees SHALL be considered non-compliant.

---

## 5. Transport Governance

### 5.1 OpticalTransportMode Authority (Governance Form)

The governance layer SHALL treat `OpticalTransportMode` as a closed six-value enum.

```ts
export enum OpticalTransportMode {
  DIRECT,
  WAVELENGTH,
  PACKETIZED,
  HYBRID,
  EMULATED,
  SIMULATED
}
```

No implementation MAY introduce non-governed transport modes without
specification extension approval.

Note: The `logicn-core-photonic-v02.md` formal spec uses a different set of
values (Waveguide/Coherent/Mesh/FreeSpace/Hybrid/Experimental). This governance
spec's DIRECT/WAVELENGTH/PACKETIZED/HYBRID/EMULATED/SIMULATED values represent
a governance-layer abstraction. The conflict must be resolved before implementation.

### 5.2 Transport Validation

Every execution plan MUST pass transport validation before runtime activation.

Validation includes: transport compatibility, topology support, runtime support,
deterministic constraints, capability compliance.

The governance validator SHALL reject: undefined transport transitions, unsupported
hybrid combinations, runtime-mode mismatches, topology conflicts.

### 5.3 Transport Isolation

Transport domains MUST remain isolated unless explicitly bridged.

Governance MUST ensure: wavelength isolation integrity, packet-domain boundary
protection, hybrid transport mediation, deterministic transport routing.

Implicit transport escalation is prohibited.

### 5.4 Hybrid Transport Governance

`HYBRID` transport introduces elevated governance requirements.

Hybrid execution plans MUST: explicitly define mode boundaries, declare transport
arbitration rules, provide deterministic fallback sequencing, expose topology
mapping guarantees.

Hybrid plans lacking deterministic arbitration SHALL be rejected.

---

## 6. Topology Governance

### 6.1 Topology Authority

Topology definitions SHALL be treated as governed execution primitives.

Governance applies to: topology shape, routing semantics, transport adjacency,
propagation constraints, execution path guarantees.

### 6.2 Topology Validation

Validation MUST verify: graph integrity, non-cyclic constraints where required,
deterministic route availability, transport compatibility, capability alignment.

Topology validation functions SHALL be mandatory for runtime admission.

### 6.3 Deterministic Routing

Routing decisions MUST be reproducible.

Prohibited: randomized route selection, implicit topology mutation, nondeterministic
balancing, runtime graph divergence.

When multiple valid paths exist: ordering rules MUST be explicit, priority selection
MUST be stable, tie-breaking MUST be deterministic.

### 6.4 Topology Mutation Governance

| Mutation Type | Governance Requirement |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Static | Allowed during compile phase |
| Planned Dynamic | Allowed if pre-authorized |
| Emergent Runtime | Prohibited |

Runtime topology mutation without governance authorization SHALL invalidate
the execution plan.

---

## 7. Runtime Capability Governance

### 7.1 PhotonicCapability Governance

Capabilities MUST define: supported transports, supported topologies, execution
guarantees, deterministic compliance, operational boundaries.

### 7.2 Capability Negotiation

Capability negotiation MUST be explicit. Implicit capability acquisition is prohibited.

Required: declared capability dependencies, deterministic capability ordering,
capability compatibility validation, version alignment checks.

### 7.3 Capability Enforcement

A runtime target MUST NOT execute beyond its declared capabilities.

SHALL reject: unsupported topology execution, undeclared transport execution,
invalid hybrid orchestration, incompatible execution delegation.

### 7.4 Capability Isolation

Capabilities SHALL be sandbox-governed.

Isolation rules: transport isolation, execution isolation, topology isolation,
state propagation controls.

Capability boundaries MUST remain observable and auditable.

---

## 8. Runtime Target Governance

### 8.1 PhotonicRuntimeTarget Governance

A runtime target MUST expose: runtime identifier, supported transport modes,
supported topology families, capability registry, validation interfaces,
deterministic compliance status.

### 8.2 Runtime Admission Control

Before execution, governance MUST validate:
1. runtime authenticity
2. runtime compatibility
3. capability sufficiency
4. deterministic compliance
5. topology support
6. transport support

Execution admission MUST fail closed.

### 8.3 Runtime Trust Boundaries

Cross-domain execution requires: transport governance approval, topology
compatibility, capability equivalence, deterministic synchronization.

Untrusted runtime delegation is prohibited.

---

## 9. Execution Plan Governance

### 9.1 PhotonicExecutionPlan Governance

The execution plan MUST fully describe: topology intent, transport intent,
capability requirements, deterministic sequencing, runtime allocation, validation status.

### 9.2 Immutable Plan Semantics

Execution plans MUST be immutable after validation.

Prohibited: runtime mutation, implicit optimization rewriting, topology drift,
transport substitution.

A modified plan MUST undergo revalidation.

### 9.3 Plan Validation Pipeline

```text
Specification Validation
    ↓
Transport Validation
    ↓
Topology Validation
    ↓
Capability Validation
    ↓
Determinism Validation
    ↓
Runtime Admission
    ↓
Execution Authorization
```

Failure at any stage MUST terminate admission.

### 9.4 Execution Authorization

Requires: validated plan state, compatible runtime target, deterministic
compliance, topology integrity, transport authorization.

Unsigned or partially validated plans SHALL NOT execute.

---

## 10. Validation Governance

### 10.1 Validation Functions

Validation implementations MUST: be deterministic, be side-effect free,
produce reproducible outputs, expose explicit failure states.

### 10.2 Validation Categories

| Category | Responsibility |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Transport Validation | Transport compatibility enforcement |
| Topology Validation | Graph integrity and routing checks |
| Capability Validation | Runtime capability verification |
| Determinism Validation | Stable execution guarantees |
| Runtime Validation | Runtime target integrity checks |
| Plan Validation | End-to-end execution verification |

### 10.3 Failure Semantics

Validation failures MUST: halt execution, produce machine-readable diagnostics,
expose deterministic error codes, emit governance audit events.

Silent validation degradation is prohibited.

---

## 11. Policy Enforcement Governance

### 11.1 Governance Policies

Policy domains: transport authorization, topology authorization, capability
authorization, runtime trust governance, execution scheduling, deterministic enforcement.

### 11.2 Policy Resolution

Conflicting policies SHALL resolve according to:
1. explicit deny
2. runtime safety
3. topology integrity
4. transport stability
5. execution optimization

### 11.3 Governance Policy Hierarchy

```text
Global Governance Policy
    ↓
Runtime Governance Policy
    ↓
Topology Governance Policy
    ↓
Transport Governance Policy
    ↓
Execution Plan Policy
```

Lower-level policies MUST NOT violate higher-level governance rules.

---

## 12. Audit & Trace Governance

### 12.1 Audit Requirements

Audit records SHALL include: runtime target, execution plan identifier, transport
selection, topology resolution, capability negotiation, validation outcomes,
policy enforcement actions.

### 12.2 Deterministic Traceability

Governance traces MUST support deterministic replay, reconstructing: execution
sequencing, validation decisions, topology routing, capability negotiation,
transport arbitration.

### 12.3 Governance Event Model

| Event | Description |

| EXECUTION_ABORTED | Governance failure triggered abort |

---

## 13. LLN-PHOTONIC Governance Compliance

LLN-PHOTONIC-001 through LLN-PHOTONIC-006 governance requirements introduced
in v0.2 SHALL be treated as normative controls.

Governance implementations MUST preserve: transport determinism, topology
integrity, explicit runtime targeting, validation completeness, capability
governance, immutable execution semantics.

---

## 14. Governance Security Model

Governance assumes: authenticated runtime targets, deterministic validators,
immutable execution plans, policy-authorized execution.

Prohibited: unauthorized runtime substitution, implicit capability escalation,
topology tampering, transport spoofing, nondeterministic execution rewriting.

Integrity mechanisms SHOULD include: execution plan signatures, runtime
attestation, deterministic validation hashing, immutable audit chains.

---

## 15. Future Governance Extensions

MAY introduce: adaptive topology governance, quantum-photonic execution
governance, distributed wavelength arbitration, formal verification pipelines,
cryptographic execution attestation, autonomous transport governance.

MUST preserve: deterministic execution guarantees, explicit capability
governance, validation-first execution semantics, immutable governance auditability.

---

```md
## Governance Architecture

LogicN Core Photonic v0.2 introduces a deterministic governance architecture layer covering:

- transport governance
- topology governance
- runtime capability governance
- deterministic execution enforcement
- execution plan validation
- audit traceability
- LLN-PHOTONIC-001–006 compliance

See: docs/Knowledge-Bases/logicn-core-photonic-governance-architecture.md
```

### 18.3 Legacy KB Migration Notes

The prior backend architecture KB used:
- a three-value `OpticalTransportMode` string union
- earlier `PhotonicRuntimeTarget` field definitions
- earlier LLN-PHOTONIC semantic meanings

This governance architecture formalizes migration to:
- six-value `OpticalTransportMode` enum (governance form)
- governed `PhotonicRuntimeTarget` v0.2 semantics
- governed `PhotonicExecutionPlan` semantics
- explicit validation pipelines
- deterministic execution governance
- topology-aware runtime orchestration

Legacy semantics SHOULD be marked deprecated but retained for historical
compatibility reference.
