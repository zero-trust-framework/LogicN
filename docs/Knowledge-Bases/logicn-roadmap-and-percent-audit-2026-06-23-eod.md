# LogicN — % Completion Audit + Security-First Roadmap (2026-06-23, end of session)

> **Supersedes** the earlier same-day draft `logicn-roadmap-and-percent-audit-2026-06-23.md` (~76%), which predates a full day of zero-trust hardening. This is the authoritative end-of-session state. Verify counts with `node scripts/status.mjs`, `npm test`, and `npm run compare` (the numbers below are from the 2026-06-23 runs on i9-9900K).

## Headline

Today was **correctness + zero-trust hardening, not feature growth.** The day closed several *live fail-opens*, built the first mechanical detector for an entire bug class, and re-confirmed the publishing posture (0 flagship papers, by design). Net completion is **~77%** (weighted) — a modest rise over the morning's ~76% that **understates** the real gain: the security dimension is materially better *audited and guarded* (SEC-002 mutation: every fail-closed gate killed), even as the same work *surfaced* a backlog of hardening items now on the roadmap.

## 1. % audit by dimension

| Dimension | % | Evidence / change today |
|---|---:|---|
| Specification / KB | 100% | 4-layer KB; +`logicn-fail-open-taxonomy`, +`scientific-papers/` (the `.tmf` defensive paper + standard) |
| Compiler core (lexer→governance→GIR) | ~92% | **3 live fail-opens fixed** (#163 inline-`;;`-swallows-paren → stub-returns-5; #165 `%`-on-Float; guarded-flow value-state omission) + regression tests; full compiler suite **3176/3176** |
| Security & governance core | ~90% | **SEC-002 mutation: ALL gates killed** (every registered fail-closed gate genuinely guarded); `lint-wat-inline-comments` shipped as the first fail-open-class detector; native-bridge missing-authorization (CWE-862) fix verified (`5130111`, 16/16) |
| Tests — full suite | 100% | **53/53 packages · 5,042 tests** (full-suite count; compiler subset 3176) |
| Type / effect / value-state | ~90% | guarded-flow tier now value-state-walked; `LLN-TIER-001` tier-floor designed + approved (not yet built) |
| WASM emitter | ~90% | the 8 expression traps + static-const/bitfield now inline-safe block comments; lint-gated |
| Runtime interpreter (Stage-A diagnostic) | ~87% | benchmark oracle; not the product |
| Stage-B self-hosting (P9 WASM) | ~80% | `tokenize` byte-parity (#143); parser/checker/verifier flows remain |
| Application-framework layer | ~74% | 0091 base packages built (auth/observability/test/docs/example-app golden template); api-server TLS mapper landed (#0089); signed registry index = remaining gap |
| B8 governed HTTP transport (TLSTP) | in progress | S1 K3 cert-gate shipped (126 tests); `canCommit` deny-by-default tightening (Option A) approved |
| Post-Quantum & hardware security | ~38% | hybrid Ed25519+ML-DSA-65 on attestation/proof/bridge; `.lmanifest` hybrid gated on #34 key custody |
| **`.tmf` universal trust-capsule format** | slices 1–3 + **paper** | TMX-256 + container + KEM-DEM golden-verified; quantum-resilient; **defensive-publication paper** written; ML-DSA-65 root-signing (slice 4) next |
| AI Inference Tower (BitNet/NVFP4) | ~12% | governed dev stubs/simulators |
| Photonic / ternary | ~3% | software simulation only (design + emulator) |

**Benchmark snapshot (§1.5 production-ceiling, 2026-06-23):** WASM ▶ production **won** `hardware-targets` + `fibonacci-recursive`; **2.0–3.6×** the winner on most hot compute; `governance-cost` 293× (the per-decision K3 fold — the honest cost of compiling governance in). Winner tally: Node 5 · Rust-AVX2 5 · Rust-generic 5 · WASM-prod 2 · Deno-GPU 1. `tri-logic`/`data-query` excluded (not unit-aligned, R&D 0092).

**Audit health (2026-06-23 sweep):** coverage holes **0** · SEC-002 mutants **all killed** · `lint-wat-inline-comments` clean · doc-drift: `CHANGELOG` 48→53 package count (fix queued) · `lint-conventions` has informational violations · graph 4810 nodes / 5443 edges.

## 2. The honest gap — still concentrated in 3 places

1. **Real isolation runtime (`DSS.wasm` Wasmtime TCB, #102–106).** The "Tower" / kernel-bypass / in-WASM-supervisor guarantees are **design intent**, enforced today by the Stage-A TS simulation. Until the real `DSS.wasm` lands, treat kernel-bypass as aspirational.
2. **Post-quantum key custody (#34/#149).** Hybrid signing ships on attestation/bridge surfaces, but the `.lmanifest` is Ed25519-only pending production key custody + the offline ceremony.
3. **Framework completion.** The servable api-server/example-app shipped; the **signed registry index** + full kernel-auth wiring of the S1 cert-gate are the remaining framework seams.

---

## 3. SECURITY-FIRST roadmap (owner-confirmed ordering)

> Hardening before features. Verify-before-build → build → test → commit per chunk.

### NEAR — the approved security build queue (build, not research)
1. **`canCommit()` Option A** — tighten `bitnet-cpu-bridge` to `checkTransition(0,1)` only (fail-closed-by-default; CWE-863). Grep all native callers + sign the positive test first. *(smallest; closes the inert-predicate)*
2. **Value-state 34B-hole** — scoped VS-003-only auto-taint + new **`LLN-VALUESTATE-008`** (warning→error migration; ~6.7% corpus breakage, scoping drops the false positives).
3. **Flow-kind `LLN-TIER-001` floor (S1–S4)** — infer min governance tier from the effect footprint; reject `declared < inferred`, escalate-only; + the dead `LLN-DAG-002`; + the `//lln` propose-into-`//@` writer.
4. **Fail-open-class detectors** (from `logicn-fail-open-taxonomy.md`, `lint-wat-inline-comments` is the template): bridge deny-by-default conformance test · cross-pass flow-kind exhaustiveness scan · fake-native-addon branch test (+ SEC-002 on the commit gate) · gate-defined-but-never-called call-graph scan.
5. **`component-health.mjs`** — the owner-requested per-component roll-up (builds/tests/fail-open-lints/dangerous-path coverage); pure-read `--fast` so it can't repeat the shared-tree collision.
6. **53 Black-Hole "intrusion-triggered arena fill"** — wire the shipped `memory.fill(0)` to a live K3 −1 + spec the revocation-gated mesh cascade.

### MID — features behind the hardening front
- TritMesh net-new mechanics **#2** (K3 partial-return `Result.Masked`) + **#3** (T-as-signed-artifact rail); TRACK a/b/c.
- Framework: **signed registry index**, wire the S1 cert-gate into live kernel auth, 0066 first-3 (handshake-bind · raw-byte shim · ECH/OHTTP).
- Stage-B P9: extend `tokenize` byte-parity to parser/checker/verifier flows.
- **`.tmf` universal-format track** (folded into the main roadmap per owner): slice 4 (ML-DSA-65 root signing / verify-before-read), then the custody/threshold slices; the standalone-repo extraction stays parked.

### LONG — owner/infra-gated
- `DSS.wasm` Wasmtime TCB (#102–106) — the real isolation runtime (DRCM Phase 5).
- PQ key custody (#34/#149) + the offline ceremony → `.lmanifest` hybrid.
- Photonic PPU virtualisation (hardware-gated; emulator + governance rails only today).
