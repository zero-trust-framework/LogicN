# Galerina — R&D Results Log (quick-lookup verdict table)

**Purpose.** One-glance lookup of *what R&D concluded and why* — **positive AND negative**. A REFUTED idea is as
valuable as an adopted one: recording *why we did not adopt* stops it being re-proposed (the corpus repeatedly finds
~80% of "new" ideas re-derive shipped architecture). **Standing process (owner 2026-06-23):** when an R&D job comes
back (`_session-bridge/done/NNNN-*.done.md`), the hub absorbs it into the KB and **adds a row here** — adopted or
refuted, with the reason — then refreshes the KB index. See [[feedback-rd-absorb-positive-and-negative]].

**Verdict legend:** ✅ ADOPTED (built/shipped) · 🧪 DESIGNED (KB design, build pending) · 🔭 TRACKED (track-not-build)
· ❌ REFUTED (not adopted + reason) · ⏳ PENDING (dispatched, awaiting `done/`) · 🔒 GATED (owner/HW/infra-gated).

> Full doc-level absorption history is in [galerina-rd-absorption-catalog.md](galerina-rd-absorption-catalog.md); per-cluster
> disposition tables (every finding, both directions) live in e.g. [galerina-transport-auth-research-explained-2026-06-22.md](galerina-transport-auth-research-explained-2026-06-22.md).
> This log is the *quick-lookup verdict roll-up* across them.

## 2026-06-28 — RD-0168 (graph-driven PCI/DSS + security compliance scanner — owner tool ask)

🧪 DESIGN (build-ready, ADOPT-additive) · **ZT 9** · proof `scripts/rd-0168-graph-pci-compliance-scanner-proof.mjs`
(31/31) · paper=defensive(+modest scientific). Full doc:
[graph-pci-compliance-scanner](galerina-rd-0168-graph-pci-compliance-scanner.md). Turns PCI requirements into
**monotone reachability predicates over a SIGNED governance graph**: the shipped `galerina-devtools-pci` checker is
per-flow AST (local) and cannot answer *"does PAN REACH an egress/log/store sink with no encrypt/redact/audit edge?"*
— RD-0168 is the thin taint-reachability layer that can (`SPORE-PCI-G-000/004/005/006`). K3 fail-closed (unknown-class
source → sink = INDETERMINATE, never silent PASS). **Load-bearing ZT (V7):** the scanner must read a SIGNED graph
(RD-0167) — an unsigned in-`.spore` graph lets an attacker delete the PAN→egress edge → scanner PASSes a still-leaking
program (fail-OPEN); Ed25519-covering closes it. ~70% reuse (project-graph algos + BoundaryGraph + compiler taint
tags); net-new = DataFlowGraph builder + 4 predicate checks. Build ≈2–3 days, additive.

## 2026-06-28 — RD-0169 (TritMesh/Galerina AWS-decoupled deployment + K3 tri-state software protocol — note 09)

🧪 DESIGN · **ZT 6** · proof `scripts/rd-0169-tritmesh-aws-decoupled-tristate-proof.mjs` (31/31) · paper=defensive.
Owner note `76-mesh-r-d-09` ("just R&D, add to KB"): Galerina compute decoupled from a headless TritMesh DB over a
DB-connection API + `.spore` storage (S3/EBS) + Redis cache, with a `tri_state_vector {storage,cache,node} ∈
{+1,0,-1}` driving routing on binary silicon (2-bit/enum). Mostly **re-derives RD-0161** (headless `.spore`-stream
DiD) + **RD-0150** (graph border). Sound AVAILABILITY patterns (proven): stale-while-revalidate on `cache=0` collapses
a stampede N→1 refetch; deterministic 27-vector tri-state routing; lag-`node=0` read-only. **Load-bearing caveat (same
class as RD-0162/0164/0165):** the `tri_state_vector` is operator-trustable HEALTH telemetry and must NEVER become a
security/admission verdict — a forged `[+1,+1,+1]` is admitted with no secret if health gates admission (proven
fail-open); admission stays keyed on the signed `.spore` capability. `authorize(0)=false`, `vAnd`=min downgrades-only,
so "stale/syncing→0" never launders into ALLOW; "serve stale" applies to DATA, never AUTH (stale/unknown auth =
INDETERMINATE→deny). The DB-connection API stays a TLS + SSRF + signed-index (RD-0167) border.

## Refuted — and WHY we did not adopt (the negative record)
| Idea | Verdict | Why refuted |
|---|---|---|
| Photonic SHA-256 / any crypto-on-photonic | ❌ REFUTED | crypto/keys stay Binary by invariant; analog can't be a key (No-Coercion); photonic = degrade-only operand only |
| Photonic state as a signature/auth byte | ❌ REFUTED | PAC-learnable optical state; crypto-on-core violation → demoted to a degrade-only K3 tamper signal *under* the digital Ed25519+ML-DSA-65 sig |
| Ternary Ephemeral Ratchet (analog `E_ternary` in the KDF) | ❌ REFUTED | hard crypto-on-core violation |
| Continuous float trust `T_c` as the gate | ❌ REFUTED | conflicts with discrete fail-closed K3 → telemetry-only, discretized via `vAnd` |
| TMX-256 / ML-DSA TritMesh stack for Galerina | ❌ REFUTED | keep SHA-256 (Grover→128-bit OK) + ML-DSA-65; no benefit to swapping |
| Z3/SMT proof for the cert-gate K3 algebra | ❌ REFUTED (2026-06-23) | a 4-factor `min` is already exhaustively tested by the 3⁴ truth table; Z3 belongs on tri-tier i32 conformance instead |
| Tri-logic "speeds up" JSON parsing | ❌ REFUTED | category error (K3 is governance, not parsing); the real win is a simdjson branchless classifier |
| Photonic tensor-precompute = O(1) | ❌ REFUTED | classic precompute trade (apply still O(N²); dense T_reach mem; fusion densifies 39×) — not O(1) |
| Cleartext semantic routing across a trust boundary | ❌ KILLED | SPORE-PRIVACY-002 blocks cleartext semantic embeddings at network sinks |
| `contract.invariant` "Auto self-healing immune system" (note 45 Part 2) | ❌ REFUTED | (1) loosen-on-low-risk = FAIL-OPEN (spoof telemetry → loosened net); invariants must be monotonic-tighten-only (`SPORE-MONO`); (2) synthesise conditions from analog HIV telemetry = No-Coercion violation + guessing; (3) host-side `GalerinaAutoInvariantEngine` misplaces trust (host is hostile; enforcer must be in-DSS.wasm).
