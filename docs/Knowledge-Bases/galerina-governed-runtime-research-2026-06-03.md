## Where Galerina is already AHEAD of the field

Before the enhancement list, a record of what no comparable open-source system combines:
- **Economics layer baked into the language** — no comparable open-source language combines
  `contract.economics {}` (cost/compute budgets), breach-risk matrices, and hardware-routing
  in a single governance model. Cedar, OPA, Koka, in-toto — none do this.
- **Post-quantum governance signatures in the language runtime** — ML-DSA-65 (NIST FIPS 204)
  as a first-class runtime signing primitive is unique in the language/runtime space.
- **Taint + sink guards + secret-sink trilogy** (FUNGI-SECRET-001/002/003) baked into the
  compiler as diagnostic codes — Koka/Pony/Austral don't operationalize information-flow
  to HTTP/log/serialize sinks with structured codes.

## The 8 highest-leverage enhancements (ranked)

### 1. in-toto four-layer attestation interoperability — MEDIUM difficulty, HIGH benefit
**Source:** in-toto attestation spec v1 (GitHub, 3-0 vote confirmed)

Galerina's epilogue{} proof strategies (sha256_seal / zk_snark_receipt) and governance
signatures (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65) already produce all the cryptographic artifacts. The
enhancement is a **serialisation mapping** onto the in-toto four layers:
- `Envelope` ← Galerina governance signature bundle
- `Statement` ← contract identity + module hash (the subject)
- `Predicate` ← epilogue proof strategy as a TypeURI (e.g. `galerina.io/epilogue/sha256_seal`)
- `Bundle` ← collection of governance events for a build

**Why it matters:** government procurement and healthcare supply-chain pipelines require
SLSA Level 3+ (which mandates in-toto-compatible provenance). This mapping gives Galerina
interoperability with Sigstore/Rekor transparency logs at near-zero cost since the
cryptographic infrastructure is already in place.

**Action:** define the TypeURI scheme for Galerina predicate types; write a manifest
serialiser that wraps the existing governance signature in an in-toto Envelope.

---

### 2. OPA decision-log telemetry for contract block evaluations — LOW difficulty, HIGH benefit
**Source:** OPA management documentation (official OPA docs, 3-0 vote)

OPA's decision log captures per-decision telemetry: policy path, input data, result,
client identifier, RFC3339 timestamp, bundle revision. It also supports **sensitive-data
masking** via `data.system.log.mask` — erased field paths are recorded on the log event
so the audit trail is preserved without PII leakage.

**Mapping to Galerina:** `contract.audit {}` could emit structured decision-log events for
every governance check that fires (effect boundary, taint gate, economic limit) — not
just the final pass/fail. Masked fields map directly onto `contract.privacy {}` redaction
rules already in the language. The result: a per-request governance telemetry stream
that healthcare / government deployments can route to SIEM without exposing PII.

**Action:** add an audit-event emitter to the governance verifier that produces structured
log entries per check; wire `contract.privacy {}` field masks onto the log masking layer.

---

### 3. Cedar-style external policy bundles — MEDIUM difficulty, HIGH benefit
**Source:** Cedar ACM OOPSLA 2024 paper (3-0 vote confirmed)

Cedar's core insight: **policies are separate from application code** — they can be
independently authored, updated, analysed, and audited without recompiling the application.
Currently Galerina `contract {}` blocks are compiled into the module they govern, coupling
compliance lifecycle to development lifecycle.

**Mapping to Galerina:** introduce versioned governance bundle files (`*.fungipolicy`) that
the runtime can load separately from the compiled module. The governance verifier binds
the module's governance signature to the loaded bundle's hash. Compliance teams can
update `authority {}` / `effects {}` / `privacy {}` clauses without touching application
code. Directly valuable for the healthcare and government target markets.

**Action:** define a bundle-loader protocol; extend the governance signature to cover the
bundle hash alongside the module hash.

---

### 4. Pony deny-property capability reframing — MEDIUM difficulty, HIGH benefit
**Source:** Pony 'Deny Capabilities for Safe, Fast Actors' (AGERE 2015, 3-0 vote)

Pony's capabilities are specified as **deny properties** — what an alias is forbidden to
read/write — rather than permit properties (what it is allowed to do). This makes
isolation properties easier to prove by inspection.

The `tag` concept — an opaque reference passable through a call chain without exposing
internal state — maps naturally onto Galerina's authority-token model.

**Mapping to Galerina:** reframe `contract.authority {}` and `contract.effects {}` to
include deny semantics: "this module may not read secret bindings directly; it may only
call them through their declared accessor interface." The taint checker's sink guards are
already expressed in deny terms (FUNGI-SECRET-001: must not log); extending this to the
full capability model would give stronger static isolation guarantees.

**Action:** add `deny:` qualifiers to `contract.authority {}` blocks; extend the
governance verifier to check deny properties against the flow body AST.

---

### 5. Austral linear types for secrets/keys/handles — HIGH difficulty, HIGH benefit
**Source:** Austral language documentation (official, 3-0 vote)

Austral's linear types statically prevent: secret leaks (unused linear variable = compiler
error), use-after-revocation (consuming a value twice = rejected), and double-close
(closing a resource twice = rejected). The compiler enforces these without runtime cost.

**Mapping to Galerina:** `contract.secrets {}` values and cryptographic key objects are
natural candidates for a **restricted linear fragment** — they can only be used exactly
once, must be explicitly consumed (redacted, encrypted, or passed to a declared sink), and
cannot be silently discarded. This elevates FUNGI-SECRET-001/002/003 from "detected at the
check pass" to "impossible by construction in the type system."

**Incremental path:** introduce a `once` type qualifier (not a full linear type system).
`once String` bindings can be passed to exactly one sink; attempting to pass them to a
second sink is a compile error. This covers 90% of the secret-lifecycle benefit at medium
difficulty.

**Action:** design the `once` type qualifier; extend the type checker and value-state
checker to enforce single-consumption of `once`-qualified bindings.

---

### 6. Koka row-polymorphic effect types — HIGH difficulty, HIGH benefit
**Source:** Koka, MSFP 2014, arXiv 1406.2061 (3-0 / 2-1 votes)

Koka provides a soundness theorem (Theorem 6): a function typed without the `exn` effect
is statically **guaranteed never to throw an unhandled exception.** Row-polymorphism
lets effects be composed without hard-coding them.

**Mapping to Galerina:** Galerina's effect checker currently compares declared effects against
observed effects but does not provide row-polymorphic effect *types* on flow signatures.
Adding this would let a utility flow be generic over its effect context — safe in both
strict and standard profiles because its effect row is inferred rather than hard-coded.
The `exn`-equivalent would be: a flow whose effect row excludes `network` is statically
guaranteed not to make network calls, stronger than the current "declared effects must
match" check.

**Action:** extend the effect system with row-typed effect annotations on flow signatures;
implement inference for utility flows.

---

### 7. Bi-temporal / differential indexing for context receipts — LOW difficulty, MEDIUM benefit
**Source:** emerging agentic code-indexing frameworks (synthesis)

Traditional code indexing requires global re-indexing on every file change. Bi-temporal
tracking stamps each indexed node with the cryptographic hash of the source file version.
When a file changes, only the nodes touched by that AST delta are re-indexed.

**Mapping to Galerina:** `galerina-devtools-intelligence` (new package, 2026-06-03) already
indexes flows. Adding SHA-256 file version stamps and differential re-indexing would keep
the AI search index synchronized with source edits without full rebuilds.

**Action:** extend the intelligence indexer to stamp each flow with the file content hash;
re-index only flows from files whose hash changed since the last index run.

---

### 8. W3C PROV provenance vocabulary for data lineage — MEDIUM difficulty, MEDIUM benefit
**Source:** W3C PROV specification and OpenLineage (provenance standards)

W3C PROV defines a vocabulary for describing provenance: `Entity` (data artifacts),
`Activity` (processes), `Agent` (responsible parties), and the relationships
`wasGeneratedBy`, `used`, `wasAttributedTo`. OpenLineage extends this for data pipelines.

**Mapping to Galerina:** `galerina-devtools-provenance` (new package, 2026-06-03) already
builds a source→transform→sink graph. Emitting this graph in W3C PROV format would
make Galerina's data lineage machine-readable by compliance tools that consume PROV (GDPR
Article 30 data-processing registers, HIPAA audit trails, CCPA data-subject reports).

**Action:** add a PROV serialisation mode to `galerina-devtools-provenance`; define PROV
term mappings (Galerina `unsafe let` = `Entity` with `wasGeneratedBy` a network source;
Galerina gate call = `Activity`; DB write = `wasUsedBy` an `Agent`).

## Second-run addendum (112-agent re-run, 790 tool calls, 2026-06-03)

Three high-confidence findings from the second independent adversarial run that add to the first:

### A. Cedar Lean mechanization as the top-priority formal-proof template (3-0, HIGH)
Cedar's Lean mechanization (arXiv:2403.04651, OOPSLA 2024) catches 4 bugs in the policy
validator that testing missed, and provides machine-checked proofs of: sound-and-complete
logical encoding; refactoring safety (authorized permissions provably unchanged); validator
properties. The **verification-guided development (VGD)** methodology (arXiv:2407.01688)
is a replicable process — an executable Lean model tested against the production compiler
via differential random testing. **Galerina is AHEAD**: it combines economics + secrets +
epilogue in one block; Cedar only covers authorization. A Lean mechanization of Galerina's
governance verifier would be novel academic and industrial work.

### B. WASM Component Model shared-nothing memory for cross-flow isolation (3-0, MEDIUM)
The WASM Component Model mandates that every component gets its own isolated linear memory;
sharing data requires explicit typed interfaces (WIT bindings). This maps directly onto
Galerina's governed flow boundaries: a `secure` flow calling an `effects { database.write }`
sub-flow could be compiled to separate WASM components with typed WIT interfaces, making
capability-boundary crossings **physically enforced** by the runtime rather than only
checked at compile time. Adoption difficulty: MEDIUM (requires GIR emitter to target
WASM Component Model, not just WAT modules).

### C. CapTP-style capability delegation for governed cross-node flows (2-1, MEDIUM)
CapTP (from Spritely Goblins / E language) enables **capability delegation across trust
boundaries** using promise-based message passing — a remote capability is a first-class
object whose authority can be selectively delegated. For Galerina's governed distributed
runtime (multi-node deployments in healthcare/finance), this maps onto: a governed flow
running on Node A can delegate a capability handle to Node B without exposing the
underlying resource; the delegation itself is a governance event tracked in the ProofGraph.
Adoption difficulty: MEDIUM-HIGH (requires a distributed runtime extension). The 2-1 vote
(vs 3-0 for others) reflects that CapTP's production maturity is less established than
the other referenced systems.

### Second-run top-6 ranking (overlaps with + confirms first-run)
1. Cedar Lean mechanization for governance verifier — HIGH difficulty, HIGH benefit (new #1)
2. OPA-style structured decision telemetry + masking — LOW difficulty, HIGH benefit (= first-run #2)
3. Koka load-bearing effect-type guarantees — HIGH difficulty, HIGH benefit (= first-run #6)
4. Sigstore-compatible self-contained governance bundles — LOW-MEDIUM difficulty, HIGH benefit
5. WASM Component Model shared-nothing isolation — MEDIUM difficulty, HIGH benefit (new)
6. CapTP capability delegation for distributed flows — MEDIUM-HIGH difficulty, MEDIUM benefit (new)

## §Refuted (did not survive adversarial verification)
- Cedar objectively outperforms OPA/OpenFGA on request evaluation (0-3)
- Cedar VGD methodology discovers 25 bugs through proofs + DRT combined (1-2)
- Pony achieves data-race freedom with performance comparable to unsafe CAF (0-3)
- Koka effect inference is sound AND complete (0-3) — only the exn-specific soundness theorem confirmed
- Row-typed algebraic effects generalize monads without composition constraints (0-3)
- SLSA provenance must use in-toto format per spec (0-3) — in-toto is recommended, not mandatory

---

## Open questions for the Galerina design team
1. Does the existing manifest serialisation format have enough structure to map onto
   the in-toto Statement/Predicate layers without a new serialisation scheme?
2. Would deny-property capability reframing require backward-incompatible changes to
   `contract.authority {}` and `contract.effects {}` syntax?
3. Is there an incremental path to linear types that covers only `secrets {}`-derived
   values (a restricted `once` fragment) without a full linear type system?
4. What is the practical cost of externalising `contract {}` blocks as versioned policy
   bundles given the governance verifier currently operates on embedded contracts?
