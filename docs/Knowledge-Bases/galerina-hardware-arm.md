# Galerina — ARM Hardware Support

**Version: 1.0 — 2026-06-01**
**Status: Architecture direction — Phase 33+ implementation**

---

## Position Statement

```
Galerina treats ARM as a first-class Governance Execution Target.

ARM hardware is used to reduce energy cost, increase throughput,
improve memory safety, and strengthen isolation.

ARM hardware never grants authority.

A flow must satisfy all governance, capability, privacy, audit, safety,
and runtime policy requirements before ARM acceleration is considered.

ARM improves execution. Governance determines execution.
```

---

## Why ARM Matters to Galerina

AMD and Intel optimise for raw throughput and high-performance compute.

ARM optimises for:
- Energy efficiency
- Predictable execution
- Memory isolation
- Edge computing
- Large-scale cloud density

These characteristics map directly to Galerina's target markets:
```
Healthcare      Government      Defence
Aerospace       Edge AI         IoT
Critical Infrastructure         National Security
```

ARM's security extensions (MTE, PAC, BTI, Realm) align with Galerina's governance model in ways that x86 cannot match. ARM hardware can **enforce** governance constraints at the silicon level, not just in software.

## ARM CPU Profiles

### ARM Neon (`arm.neon`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.neon
}
```

**Purpose:** General-purpose vector processing — the lowest common denominator.

Available on virtually all modern ARM CPUs (ARMv7+).

Best for:
- Validation pipelines
- JSON/binary parsing
- Hashing
- String operations
- Compiler workloads

This is the safe, universal baseline for ARM-deployed Galerina services.

### ARM SVE2 (`arm.sve2`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.sve2
}
```

**Purpose:** Scalable Vector Extension 2 — vector-length-agnostic execution.

**The key advantage:** SVE2 code scales automatically across future ARM hardware without recompilation. A Galerina binary compiled for SVE2 will use 128-bit on Cortex-A78, 256-bit on future Graviton, 512-bit on future datacenter ARM — the same binary, better performance on newer silicon.

Best for:
- Governed analytics pipelines
- Large validation pipelines
- Cryptographic verification (GovernanceSignature generation)
- ExecutionGraph traversal
- ProofGraph construction

### ARM SME2 (`arm.sme2`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.sme2
}
```

**Purpose:** Streaming Matrix Engine 2 — matrix/tensor acceleration.

This is the ARM equivalent of:
- AMD XDNA / Matrix Cores
- Intel AMX
- GPU tensor engines

Best for:
- AI inference under `ai.infer` effect
- Tensor operations for risk modelling
- Large-scale analytics
- Mission planning calculations

Under Galerina governance: AI inference using SME2 is subject to the same `ai.approved_models`, `ai.max_token_cost`, and `ai.max_model_calls` constraints as cloud AI — the hardware target does not weaken AI governance.

### ARM Cloud (`arm.cloud`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.cloud
}
```

Maps to:
- AWS Graviton (3, 4+)
- Microsoft Azure Cobalt ARM
- Ampere Altra / AmpereOne
- Future ARM datacenter silicon

Galerina can optimise for cost-per-request, cost-per-proof, cost-per-audit, cost-per-AI-inference rather than maximum CPU speed — which aligns directly with cloud economics and the CostGraph architecture.

## ARM Security Profiles

This is where ARM becomes uniquely powerful for Galerina. ARM security extensions enforce governance constraints at the **hardware level**, making them stronger than software-only guarantees.

### Memory Tagging Extension (`require mte`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.sve2
  require mte
}
```

**Purpose:** Hardware-enforced memory boundaries.

MTE assigns cryptographic tags to memory allocations. Pointer/tag mismatches trap immediately — before any data can be accessed incorrectly.

Galerina benefit:
- Governed memory regions (`createGovernedMemory`) get hardware MTE tags
- Any attempt to access governed memory via an untagged pointer → hardware trap
- Audit record generated automatically before the trap

**This prevents:**
- Buffer overruns that could bypass value-state checks
- Pointer misuse across capability boundaries
- Memory corruption in ProofGraph construction

### Pointer Authentication (`require pac`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.sve2
  require pac
}
```

**Purpose:** Cryptographic pointer integrity protection.

PAC signs function pointers, return addresses, and data pointers with a hardware key. Tampered pointers fail verification and trap.

Galerina benefit:
- `ExecutionGraph` function dispatch is PAC-protected
- Return addresses in governance-critical code are signed
- Aligns with `capability isolation` — capability function pointers cannot be forged

**This prevents:**
- ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) attacks on governance verifier
- Control-flow hijacking via forged capability function pointers

### Branch Target Identification (`require bti`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.sve2
  require bti
}
```

**Purpose:** Hardware control-flow integrity.

All valid branch targets must be marked with a BTI instruction. Branches to unmarked code trap.

**This prevents:**
- Jump-oriented programming attacks
- Control flow to unintended locations in the governance layer

### Realm Management Extension (`require realm_isolation`)

```galerina
hardware {
  target arm.sve2
  require mte
  require pac
  require realm_isolation
}
```

**Purpose:** Hardware-isolated execution zones (Confidential Computing on ARM).

Realm workloads execute in hardware-protected memory. The host OS, hypervisor, and other processes cannot access the Realm's memory or state.

Galerina benefit:
- `safety_critical` and `national_security` flows can run in hardware-isolated Realms
- Even a compromised host OS cannot read Realm memory
- Realm attestation can be included in the ProofGraph as hardware evidence

Best for:
- Government and defence workloads
- National security AI inference
- Medical AI with patient data

## Aerospace Example

```galerina
secure flow processFlightTelemetry(readonly telemetry: TelemetryPacket)
-> Result<FlightDecision, FlightError>

contract {
  intent {
    "Process flight telemetry with hardware-enforced memory safety and pointer integrity."
  }

  effects {
    telemetry.read
    navigation.compute
    flight_control.propose
    audit.write
  }

  value {
    classification safety_critical
    domain aerospace
    estimated_loss_per_incident 50000000
  }

  hardware {
    target arm.sve2
    require mte
    require pac
    require realm_isolation
    fallback cpu
  }

  safety {
    require deterministic_execution
    require bounded_runtime
    require validated_telemetry
    require no_unbounded_loops
  }

  audit {
    require proof_graph
    require runtime_attestation
    require hardware_target_trace
  }
}
{
  let safeTelemetry   = validate.telemetry(telemetry)?
  let proposedCommand = Navigation.computePath(safeTelemetry)?
  let checkedCommand  = SafetyEnvelope.check(proposedCommand)?

  AuditLog.write({
    event: "FlightTelemetryProcessed",
    commandHash: hash(checkedCommand),
    hardwareTarget: "arm.sve2",
    memoryTagging: "mte.enabled",
    realmIsolated: true
  })

  return Ok(checkedCommand)
}
```

This flow:
1. Requires ARM SVE2 for scalable vector telemetry processing
2. Requires MTE — hardware memory tag verification on every pointer access
3. Requires PAC — cryptographically signed function pointers
4. Requires Realm isolation — flight control logic runs in hardware-protected memory
5. Falls back to CPU if ARM SVE2 + security features unavailable
6. Records hardware target in audit trail (hardware_target_trace)

## ARM AI Governance (Sovereign Compute)

ARM SME2 enables **sovereign AI** — AI inference with no cloud dependency:

```galerina
contract {
  ai {
    approved_models { local_llm }
    max_token_cost £0.00          // no cloud spend
    require local_execution        // no data leaves device
  }

  hardware {
    target arm.sme2
    deny cloud_inference           // explicitly no cloud
    require mte
    fallback cpu
  }
}
```

This is extremely valuable for:
- Healthcare (patient data stays on-device)
- Government (classified data stays on-premise)
- Defence (no external network dependency)
- Aerospace (disconnected embedded operation)

---

## ARM Security Invariant

```

  Reduce power consumption
  Reduce latency
  Reduce cost
  Improve memory isolation (MTE)
