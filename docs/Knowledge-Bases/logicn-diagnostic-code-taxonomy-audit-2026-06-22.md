# LogicN — Diagnostic Code Taxonomy Audit (2026-06-22)

The `LLN-EFFECT-002` overload was a **symptom of a systemic disease**, not an isolated bug. This is the full
audit (task **#213**), commissioned after that finding, of **all 336 `LLN-*` diagnostic codes across ~90
families** (7 parallel auditors), with **every flag adversarially re-verified against live source**. A
companion audit of the **non-`LLN-*` namespaces** (`ERR_*`, bare `*_VIOLATION`/`*_DENIED`, CBOR tags;
`wdjnqlw27`) is appended in §6.

**Bottom line:** ~30 `LLN-*` codes are diseased (confirmed). The same five structural root causes recur across
families. The durable fix is a **registry-conformance CI lint** (proposed #215) that makes the disease
impossible to reintroduce — without it, every future code is a coin-flip.

> Build status: the #201 work is **paused** (uncommitted) pending this audit. The `LLN-EFFECT-006` split I did
> for #201 is **correct and aligns with the policy below** — but it surfaced that `devtools-project-graph`
> still carries the OLD inverted `EFFECT-002` (finding H2). Remediation is gated on owner direction.

## 1. The five root causes (the disease, generalized)

| # | Root cause | Why it's dangerous | Worst example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **R1** | **One code, multiple distinct/opposite failure modes** (+ mixed severity) | A consumer filtering by code can't tell a typo from a privilege breach; can't triage by severity | `LLN-SECRET-002` = 3 modes (timing side-channel · network exfiltration · cross-flow), 2 unregistered |
| **R2** | **One failure mode split across multiple codes** | The rule can't be filtered/gated reliably; the two copies drift | SSRF under both `LLN-NET-001` and `LLN-NET-002` |
| **R3** | **Duplicate, divergent definitions across packages** | A package redefines another's code with a *different/inverted* meaning while claiming to be canonical | `devtools-project-graph/effect-graph.ts` redefines EFFECT-002/003/004 inverted, header falsely says "canonical to logicn-core-compiler" |
| **R4** | **Inline emits with no single metadata constant** | name/severity/message live only at the call site → drift; audits can't enumerate; raw `throw new Error("LLN-…")` | `LLN-MANIFEST-*` (raw throws), `LLN-PARSE-*`, `LLN-RUNTIME-002/003` |
| **R5** | **Dead / unregistered codes** — defined-never-emitted OR emitted-never-registered | The published code set ≠ what the compiler can produce; **worse: dead codes wired as production-BLOCKING gates = false enforcement** | `LLN-MEMORY-001..007` are dead **and** listed as production blockers in `production-check.ts` |

**The single most alarming finding (R5, security):** `production-check.ts` lists `LLN-MEMORY-001/002/003/007`
as **production-blocking gates**, but those codes have **no emitter anywhere** (the borrow/move/bounds checker
is unimplemented). The gate advertises memory-safety enforcement it does not provide.

**The most common root cause (R3):** divergent duplicate definitions — `devtools-project-graph` and the
`flowgraph`/`project-graph` GRAPH codes and `CONFIG`/`CONFIG-GOV` all re-declare codes locally instead of
importing the canonical constant. This is *why* EFFECT-002 drifted even after the compiler fixed it.

---

## 2. Confirmed HIGH-severity findings (security-relevant — fix first)

| Code(s) | Issue | What's wrong | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LLN-SECRET-002** | R1 (worst) | 3 modes under one code: `SecretComparisonDenied` (timing, error, the only *registered* one) · `SecretSentToNetwork` (egress, error, **unregistered**) · `SecretCrossesFlowBoundary` (cross-flow, warning, **unregistered**) — `value-state-checker.ts:1480/1526/1873` | Split → SECRET-002 (compare) + SECRET-004 (egress) + SECRET-005 (cross-flow); register all in the invariants matrix |
| **LLN-PRIVACY-002** | R1 | `EmbeddingEgressDenied` (egress, error) + `EmbeddingCrossesFlowBoundary` (cross-flow, warning) under one code; **not in the matrix at all** — `value-state-checker.ts:1497/1564/1581` | Split → PRIVACY-002 (egress) + PRIVACY-003 (cross-flow); register both |
| **LLN-GOV-004** | R1 | 3 modes: `DENIED_TARGET_SELECTED` · `DOMAIN_GUARD_NOT_FOUND` (typo) · `DOMAIN_GUARD_POLICY_VIOLATION` (privilege breach) — `governance-verifier.ts:1406/2559/2592`. A typo and a privilege breach are indistinguishable | Split → GOV-004 + GOV-021 + GOV-022 |
| **LLN-MONO-001** | R1 | `EMERGENCY_EXPANDS_CAPABILITY` (error, "critical security violation") + `EMERGENCY_UNKNOWN_ACTION` (warning, typo) — `governance-verifier.ts:2922/2936`. *(The code #201's parse-pin work routes through.)* | Split the typo case → MONO-003 (warning); MONO-001 = expansion only |
| **LLN-INV-002** | R1 | "post-condition could not be evaluated" (fail-closed) vs "post-condition proven false" — `interpreter.ts:1097/1103`; no exported constant | Register LLN_INV_002; split "unevaluable" from "violated" |
| **LLN-ASSIMILATE-002** | R1+R4 | 3 modes (budget-not-declared advisory [spec'd, never emitted] · plugin-exceeds-budget · tower-at-capacity), both live ones are raw `throw new Error` — `tower-runtime.ts:70/75` | Split → ASSIMILATE-002/004/005; convert to structured diagnostics |
| **LLN-EFFECT-002** | R2+R3 | over-declaration fires as EFFECT-006 (compiler) **and** EFFECT-002 (devtools), while EFFECT-002 means the *opposite* (under-declaration) in the compiler — `effect-graph.ts:56/190` falsely "canonical" | Re-sync `devtools-project-graph/effect-graph.ts` to import the compiler constants |
| **LLN-NET-001/002** | R2 | SSRF/private-range block emitted under NET-002 (canonical) **and** NET-001 (`stdlib.ts:1205`); NET-001's real meaning is allowlist-denial | Retag `stdlib.ts:1205` → NET-002 |
| **LLN-INTENT-001 / GOV-001** | R2+R5 | identical `name` INTENT_BEHAVIOR_MISMATCH under two codes, **opposite severity** (INTENT-001 error/dead, GOV-001 warning/live) | Retire dead INTENT-001; GOV-001 canonical (or vice-versa); resolve severity |
| **LLN-MATCH-001 / SAFETY-006** | R2 | non-exhaustive match split: MATCH-001 (warning, enum) vs SAFETY-006 (error, Tri) | Unify under one MATCH family w/ sub-codes, or document the deliberate split + cross-ref |
| **LLN-MANIFEST-\*** | R4+R5 | two disjoint schemes: numbered 001-005 (docs-only, never emitted) vs suffix `DEPTH`/`LENGTH-OVERFLOW`/`DUPLICATE-KEY` (raw throws, unregistered) — `manifest-generator.ts:350-404` | Pick ONE scheme; register; replace raw throws with structured diagnostics |
| **LLN-MEMORY-001..007** | R5 (security) | 7 codes defined, **none emitted**; **001/002/003/007 wired as production-BLOCKING gates that can never fire** (`production-check.ts:39-42`) | Implement the checker, OR remove from the production-blocking set + mark RESERVED |
| **LLN-GRAPH-002..005** | R3 | defined twice — `flowgraph/diagnostics.ts` (security: DeadFlow/AuthorityEscalation/PiiLeakagePath/MissingAuditCoverage) vs `project-graph/core/types.ts` (generic: NODE_NOT_FOUND/…) | Re-namespace project-graph → `LLN-PGRAPH-*` |

## 3. Confirmed MEDIUM findings (correctness/clarity)

`LLN-EFFECT-001` (error under-declare + warning plain-flow-privileged, mislabeled) → split EFFECT-007 ·
`LLN-EFFECT-003` (EFFECT_BOUNDARY_VIOLATION vs devtools UNSAFE_EFFECT_IN_SAFE_FLOW) → import canonical ·
`LLN-EFFECT-004` (NON_CANONICAL/UNKNOWN + spec mislabel + devtools TRANSITIVE — 3 meanings) → reconcile ·
`LLN-VALUESTATE-006` (ProtectedBoundaryViolation + ProtectedValueAtAuditLog) → split VALUESTATE-008 ·

`LLN-RUNTIME-006` (fail-closed limit deny + after-the-fact request_time *advisory* — contradicts its own "aborted" message) → split RUNTIME-009 ·
`LLN-RUNTIME-EFFECT-GATE` (non-numbered, unregistered) → renumber ·
`LLN-CONFIG-GOV-001/002/003` (collides numerically with CONFIG-003; GOV-001/002 are text-embedded, not structured) ·

`LLN-MUTATION-001/002` (Stage-B `.lln`-only; no name/severity; `verifyMutationPolicy` defined but never called) ·
`SEC/EC/ID/AU/OBS-002` (naming/const-export gaps) · `LLN-FAULT-001/003` (no constants; FAULT-002 gap).

## 4. Confirmed LOW findings (hygiene)

`LLN-ASSUME-001` (two names, one mode) · `LLN-CAP-001` (NETWORK_WILDCARD_BANNED fires on all wildcards incl. `database.*`) ·
`LLN-GOV-008` (registered, empty-stub emit) · `LLN-SYNTAX-006` (LET_AT_TOP_LEVEL also used for `readonly`) ·
`LLN-LEX-004` (FileTooLarge also used for token-count overflow) · `LLN-RES-001` (defined in 2 places, hand-copied name) ·
`LLN-BORDER-004` (VALUE_BELOW_MIN/ABOVE_MAX two names) + BORDER uses bespoke `SECURITY_ALERT` severity vocab ·
`LLN-BORDER-005` (spec'd, never emitted) · `LLN-BACKEND-001` (IO-error now + JS-emitter ambient-authority reserved — latent overload) ·
`LLN-WASM-*/WAT-*` (phantom — docs only) · `LLN-TAINT-002/006` (registered/defined, dead) · `LLN-BINDING-006` (defined, dead) · `LLN-IMPORT-000/001` (info unregistered; two I/O modes).

## 5. The remediation policy — "one code, one fault, one source of truth"

The standard that makes the disease impossible (this is what #213 establishes, and what a CI lint enforces):

1. **One code = one failure mode = one `name` = one severity-policy.** (A dev→prod severity toggle of the
   *same* problem is allowed; two different problems are not.)
2. **One code = one exported metadata constant** (the single source of truth), **referenced at every emit
   site.** No inline `code:"LLN-…"` literals; no raw `throw new Error("LLN-…")`. Severity/name/message live in
   the constant only.
3. **No package redefines another package's code.** Consumers `import` the canonical constant from
   `logicn-core-compiler`. (Kills R3.)
4. **Every code is either live-emittable or explicitly `RESERVED`** in the registry. Docs/README ranges must
   match emittable reality.
5. **Production-blocking gates reference only live-emittable codes.** (No advertising unenforced protection.)
6. **One uniform severity vocabulary** (`error`/`warning`/`info`) and **one numbering scheme per family** (no
   bespoke `SECURITY_ALERT`, no non-numbered `RUNTIME-EFFECT-GATE`, no colliding `CONFIG-GOV`).

**Proposed #215 — diagnostic-registry conformance lint (the durable fix).** A CI check + a generated registry
that fails the build when: a code has >1 `name`/severity at its emit sites; a code is emitted without its
exported constant; a code is defined in >1 package; a code is emitted-but-unregistered or
defined-but-never-emitted (unless `RESERVED`); a production-blocking gate names a non-live code. Without #215
the 30 fixes below will re-rot.

---

## 6. Non-`LLN-*` namespaces (companion audit `wdjnqlw27`)

*(Pending — `ERR_*` runtime codes, bare `*_VIOLATION`/`*_DENIED` trap codes, CBOR tags, and cross-namespace
collisions such as `EFFECT_BOUNDARY_VIOLATION` living as both an `LLN-EFFECT-003` `name:` and a bare code.
This section will be filled when the workflow lands.)*

---

## 7. Remediation backlog (prioritized; all gated on owner direction)

- **P0 (security): SECRET-002, PRIVACY-002, GOV-004, MONO-001, INV-002, ASSIMILATE-002** (overloaded
  security codes) + **MEMORY-001..007 false production gate** (R5 security) + **NET-001/002 SSRF** (R2).
- **P1 (correctness): EFFECT-002 devtools re-sync** + GRAPH dup re-namespace + INTENT/GOV-001 + MATCH/SAFETY-006
  + MANIFEST scheme + the EFFECT-001/003/004 family + VALUESTATE-006 + BINDING-001/002→005 + RUNTIME-002/003/006.
- **P2 (hygiene): the dead/unregistered cluster** (PARSE/INTENT/STRING/BLOCK/CHAR/PROFILE/COMPUTE/TAINT/WASM)
  + naming (ASSUME-001/002, CAP-001, CONFIG-GOV, IMPORT, LEX-004, SYNTAX-006, BORDER, BACKEND, RES-001).
- **Capstone: #215 registry-conformance lint** — do this alongside P0/P1 so fixes can't regress.

**Sequencing note (owner's runtime-first rule):** the P0 security overloads sit in the live runtime/governance
path (value-state-checker, governance-verifier, interpreter), so they rank first under that rule too.
