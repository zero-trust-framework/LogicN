# galerina-core-cli: build, verify, deploy, explain, and plan

## Status

```text
Package: galerina-core-cli
Version target: v0.2
Primary commands:
  - galerina build
  - galerina verify
  - galerina deploy
  - galerina explain
  - galerina plan
Canonical exit codes: 0 through 7
Primary outputs:
  - runtime-manifest.json
  - compiler reports
  - verification reports
  - deployment reports
  - compute plans
```

The CLI is the operational governance surface for Galerina.

It connects:

```text
compiler -> manifests -> verification -> deployment -> explainability -> compute planning
```

The CLI must remain deterministic, scriptable, machine-readable, and fail-closed.

---

# Design Goals

```text
reproducible builds
manifest-first verification
policy-aware deployment
explainable authority traces
hardware-neutral compute planning
machine-readable reports
safe CI/CD integration
stable exit codes
```

---

export type DeploymentTarget =
  | "server"
  | "edge"
  | "browser"
  | "worker"

      diagnostics.push({
        code: "FUNGI-EFFECT-002",
        severity: "error",
        message: `Effect ${effect.name} is forbidden for target ${input.target}.`
      })
    }
  }

  return diagnostics
}
```

# galerina deploy

## Purpose

`galerina deploy` validates a verified artefact against deployment policy and deploys it to the selected target.

Deployment must fail closed.

---

```bash
galerina deploy [flags]
```

---

```text
effect compatibility
boundary policy
runtime capabilities
secret handling policy

export interface ExplainTrace {
  kind:
    | "effect"
    | "boundary"
    | "capability"

    kind: input.kind,
    source: edge.from,
    target: edge.to,
    message: edge.reason
  }))
}
```

---

# galerina explain

## Purpose

`galerina explain` exposes compiler and deployment reasoning.

It explains:

```text
why an effect exists
where authority came from
which boundary denied deployment
which capability is missing
which route introduced a network effect
why a compute target was selected
```

---

## CLI Syntax

```bash
galerina explain [flags]
```

---

## Supported Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--effects` | Explain effect graph |
| `--boundaries` | Explain boundary graph |
| `--capabilities` | Explain runtime capabilities |
| `--deployment` | Explain deployment decisions |
| `--compute` | Explain compute planning |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output |
| `--verbose` | Extended trace output |

---

## Example

```bash
galerina explain --effects
```

Expected output:

```text
Function: render_profile_page

Declared effects:
- network

Inherited effects:
- network.http.request

Inherited from:
- load_profile
```

---

# ComputePlan

```ts
export interface ComputePlan {
  target: DeploymentTarget

  estimatedMemoryMb: number

  estimatedCpuCost: number

  estimatedAcceleratorCost?: number

  requiresNetwork: boolean

  requiresFilesystem: boolean

  requiresSecrets: boolean

  routes: PlannedRoute[]

  jobs: PlannedJob[]

  workers: PlannedWorker[]
}
```

---

# estimateTarget()

```ts
export function estimateTarget(
  plan: ComputePlan
): DeploymentTarget {
  if (plan.estimatedAcceleratorCost && plan.estimatedAcceleratorCost > 1000) {
    return "gpu"
  }

  if (plan.requiresFilesystem) {
    return "server"
  }

  return "edge"
}
```

---

# galerina plan

## Purpose

`galerina plan` produces execution and compute planning metadata.

The planner is governance-aware.

It considers:

```text
effects
boundaries
runtime capabilities
memory pressure
accelerator usage
network requirements
filesystem requirements
AI workloads
```

---

## CLI Syntax

```bash
galerina plan [flags]
```

---

## Supported Flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--target <target>` | Preferred target |
| `--estimate-target` | Auto-estimate best target |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output |
| `--verbose` | Extended planning diagnostics |
| `--profile <profile>` | Runtime profile |

---

## Example

```bash
galerina plan --estimate-target
```

Expected output:

```text
Estimated target: edge
Reason:
- low memory pressure
- no filesystem effects
- low accelerator usage
```

# Testing Strategy

```ts
describe("galerina verify", () => {
  it("fails when manifest hash does not match", async () => {
    const result = await verifyArtefact(invalidArtefact)

    expect(result.success).toBe(false)
    expect(result.diagnostics.some(d => d.code === "FUNGI-MANIFEST-002")).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

```ts
describe("galerina explain", () => {
  it("shows inherited effects", async () => {
    const result = await explainEffects(fixtureManifest)

    expect(result.traces.some(trace =>
      trace.message.includes("Inherited")
    )).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

---

# Fail-Closed Rules

The CLI must never:

```text
silently ignore manifest failures
silently ignore boundary denials
silently downgrade target restrictions
silently bypass verification
silently widen authority
silently deploy unverifiable artefacts
```

If verification or deployment policy is incomplete, deployment must stop.

---

# Summary

The Galerina CLI is not only a developer tool.

It is the governance execution surface for:

```text
build
verify
deploy
explain
plan
```

The canonical v0.2 contracts are:

```text
BuildArtefact
BuildResult
VerifiedArtefact
VerificationResult
DeploymentResult
ExplainTrace
ExplainResult
ComputePlan
```

The canonical deployment targets are:

```text
server
edge
browser
worker
wasm
gpu
photonic
```

The canonical CLI exit codes are:

```text
0 through 7
```

These contracts define the operational interface between the Galerina compiler, runtime, deployment system, governance layer, and future heterogeneous compute planning systems.
