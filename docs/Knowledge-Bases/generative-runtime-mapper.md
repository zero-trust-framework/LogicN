# Generative Runtime Mapper

## Status

Status: Future — This feature is not yet implemented in Stage A (Phase 1-15).
Planned for: Phase 17+

## Purpose

The Generative Runtime Mapper is a future LogicN concept for turning code,
runtime and security telemetry into an explainable intelligence map.

It fits LogicN's existing direction:

```text
machine-readable reports
AI-readable runtime state
explicit effects
typed boundaries
audit-first execution
project graphs
runtime reports
```

Core rule:

```text
The mapper observes and explains.
The mapper does not silently mutate the runtime.
```

The mapper may recommend optimisation, refactoring, isolation or security
hardening. Authority remains with explicit policy and human approval.

## Concept

The runtime and developer toolchain can continuously produce structured
signals:

```text
request flow
memory pressure
tool usage
AI worker behaviour
network activity
effect graph
permission usage
data movement
compute targets
error paths
security denials
source code structure
module relationships
test coverage signals
```

The mapper converts those signals into:

```text
runtime graph
code graph
security graph
heat map
optimization opportunities
risk reports
architecture suggestions
ML learning signals
patch proposals for review
```

## High-Level Architecture

```text
Runtime and source workspace
  -> telemetry stream and project graph
  -> event/code normalizer
  -> runtime/code graph builder
  -> ML/AI analysis worker
  -> generated insight map
  -> reviewed recommendations
```

The mapper is a consumer of facts. It should not become a privileged runtime
owner.

## Runtime Mapping

The mapper can map runtime topology:

```text
route -> handler -> database
route -> AI worker -> tool
API -> queue -> background worker
event -> policy -> effect decision
```

It can also map security behaviour:

```text
who accessed what
which permissions were used
which denials occurred
where unsafe pressure happened
which effects crossed boundaries
which actors requested sensitive tools
```

## Memory And Performance Mapping

The mapper can identify:

```text
large allocations
stream bottlenecks
copy-heavy pipelines
AI context pressure
slow routes
parallelisable tasks
SIMD/vector opportunities
GPU/AI candidate workloads
```

Example insight:

```text
FACT:
Route /orders allocates 128 MB average.

SUGGESTION:
Streaming JSON decode may reduce memory pressure.
```

The distinction between fact and suggestion is mandatory.

## AI Behaviour Mapping

The mapper can observe AI worker behaviour through typed reports:

```text
which worker requested which tool
which evidence sources succeeded
which prompts caused failures
which responses required review
which hallucination controls triggered
which context windows created pressure
```

The mapper should not rely on free-form guesses. It should use typed runtime
facts, event streams, structured reports and effect graphs first.

## Developer Code Mapping

The same mapper can help normal developer code, not only runtime or AI
behaviour.

It can map:

```text
module relationships
function call graph
effect usage
permission usage
error paths
dead code
duplicate logic
large functions
unsafe mutation
unhandled Result errors
missing tests
slow paths
memory-heavy code
```

Example developer insight:

```text
FACT:
This function performs validation, database access and response formatting.

SUGGESTION:
Split into validateInput, createOrder and buildResponse.
```

Example permission insight:

```text
FACT:
Route /orders requests database.write but only performs reads.

SUGGESTION:
Downgrade the declared permission to database.read.
```

## Generated Suggestions

The mapper may suggest:

```text
this route should stream
this AI worker needs lower context
this permission is never used
this task is GPU/vector friendly
this pipeline copies memory too often
this route should be isolated
this worker should be rate-limited
this function should be split
this module needs tests
this code path should return Result explicitly
```

Best operating model:

```text
observe
map
explain
suggest
generate patch proposal
human approves
```

The default must not be automatic rewriting.

## Security Requirements

The mapper is sensitive because it may see:

```text
runtime structure
data flow
permissions
security denials
architecture
AI prompt boundaries
tool requests
source code relationships
```

It must never expose:

```text
secrets
raw credentials
private payloads
tokens
sensitive PII
private AI prompts
authorization headers
cookies
database credentials
user secrets
```

It must support redaction, hashing and structural telemetry only:

```logicn
runtime_mapper {
  redact secrets
  hash identities
  deny payload retention
  allow structural telemetry only
}
```

This syntax is conceptual and must not be treated as implemented LogicN syntax
until the syntax is formally defined.

## Authority Boundary

The mapper must remain:

```text
observational by default
advisory by default
policy-governed
audited
review-gated
```

It must not be:

```text
self-modifying
self-authorizing
runtime-mutating
policy-bypassing
secret-retaining
```

If patch generation is added later, generated patches must be treated as
proposals. They must require explicit review before application.

## Package Planning

Possible future packages:

```text
logicn-runtime-telemetry
logicn-runtime-graph
logicn-runtime-insight
logicn-ai-runtime-analysis
logicn-runtime-evolution
logicn-dev-mapper
logicn-code-insight
logicn-code-graph
logicn-ai-code-review
logicn-refactor-planner
```

These package names are planning candidates, not committed package creation.

## Future ML Learning Signals

Eventually, runtime and code graphs may become training data for:

```text
compiler optimizers
AI coding assistants
runtime planners
security recommendation systems
architecture review tools
safe refactoring planners
```

Training exports must avoid private source, secrets, raw payloads and sensitive
user data. The preferred export is structural, redacted and provenance-linked.

## Final Principle

LogicN should be able to generate a typed runtime and code intelligence graph.

The Generative Runtime Mapper observes execution and source structure, builds
explainable structural knowledge, and helps humans and AI evolve the system
safely.

It may recommend optimisation, hardening and refactoring, but authority always
remains with explicit policy and human approval.
