# Galerina — % Completion Audit + New Roadmap (2026-06-23)

Supersedes `galerina-roadmap-and-percent-audit-2026-06-22.md`. Grounded, re-run-this-session audit (workflow
`wnu7r6l4v`, 7 agents, each re-verifying its dimension from source/tests rather than trusting prior docs). Live
full suite **53/53 packages · 5,042 tests · 0 fail** (live run logged 5,037; +5 same-session cert-gate
SEC-002 hardening tests bring core-network to 126 → 5,042). This reconciles version.json's stale 4,993 exactly:
it carried `app-kernel: 60` (live 87, +27) and no cert-gate (+22) → 4,993 + 27 + 22 = 5,042. Tiered honesty:
only shipped+verified counts as done.

## Overall: **~76%** (weighted, was 73%)
Weighting by how much each dimension defines whether Galerina *is* what it claims (not equal-weight):

| dimension | % | Δ | weight | one-line state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Language / Runtime (lexer→parser→checkers→tri-tier interp→WASM→stdlib + self-hosting) | **82** | — | 0.28 | Stage-A + governed interpreter ~100% green (3,684 tests); Stage-B WASM fail-closed-correct but **real DSS.wasm 0%** (115-byte stub); self-hosting WASM byte-parity is `tokenize`-only |
| Zero-Trust application framework (scaffold→admission/fuse→kernel→transport) | **74** | +2 | 0.22 | admission/fuse/kernel/scaffolder real + tested (kernel 87/87); **B8 transport advanced design-only → hardened-but-UNWIRED cert-gate**; api-server/example-app still non-servable stubs |
| Security & governance posture (fail-closed core, audits, B5a, key custody, DRCM, SEC-002) | **82** | +2 | 0.20 | fail-closed core real (revocation Deny-verified, registry signed+pinned, B5a mutation-killed); **today's cert-gate adds a fail-closed, mutation-asserted K3 channel gate — built+tested but not yet a live control** |
| R&D queue + greenlit build items + open roadmap | **64** | +2 | 0.13 | TLSTP **S1 cert-gate BUILT today**; B5a + 4 QA-tooling processes done; #201/#202/#216/#217 and S2–S5/0066 still open |
| Diagnostic-taxonomy remediation + dev-tooling/audit + #219 standards | **58** | +14 | 0.10 | **all 4 tooling processes (ENV-001/DOC-004/SEC-002/BLD-003) + #218 coverage now BUILT + verified**; every enforcer still report-only (`--soft`); ~13/20 #219 standards aspirational |
| TODO/ledger accuracy | **93** | −3 | 0.07 | ledger machinery excellent + self-documents staleness, but today's cert-gate landing recorded nowhere as DONE, and three stale counts (4,980 / 4,989 / 4,993) coexist |

> The +14 on the taxonomy/tooling dimension is genuine same-day build-out: DOC-004 (57fe534), SEC-002 (49a1436),
> and BLD-003 (285b61d) all materialized 2026-06-22 afternoon, *after* the 44% morning baseline was struck.

## The honest gap is still concentrated in 3 places
1. **Real DSS.wasm / Wasmtime runtime = 0%** — DRCM Phases 1–7 are Stage-A *simulation*; `dss-supervisor.wasm`
   is a 115-byte stub (all-`unreachable` bodies); no `wasmtime` dependency. (DRCM Phase 5, #102–106 —
   external-infra + owner gated.) This is the single biggest gap to a complete governed runtime.
2. **Developer-facing HTTP transport is hardened but not LIVE** — the TLSTP **S1 K3 cert-gate landed today**
   (`galerina-core-network/src/cert-gate.ts`, 22 tests, fail-closed, adversarially verified) — but it is **not yet
   imported into the kernel**: `kernel.ts:307` is still the bare `401-if-no-Authorization-header` stub, and
   `galerina-framework-api-server` / `-example-app` are still README/TODO-only (no `src/`). So the
   scaffold→admit→**serve** path still cannot carry a real request, and S1 hardens the path without changing a
   single live admission decision. (Wiring = guide step 5, the new #1 roadmap item.)
3. **Taxonomy/standards enforcement is report-only** — the 4 tooling processes are now real and self-tested, but
   every enforcer runs `--soft` (diagnostic-codes baseline 154, doc-drift 24, provenance 2) and ~13/20 #219
   standards (snapshot, triad, property/differential/coverage-threshold, proof-gating, fuzzing) are unbuilt.

## What changed since 2026-06-22
- **TLSTP S1 K3 cert/channel-validation gate — BUILT** (`galerina-core-network/src/cert-gate.ts`, 227 LOC + 22
  tests; core-network 104 → 126). The roadmap's "build-first" item: a pure-governance gate that folds a
  *library-validated* chain into one fail-closed Kleene-K3 verdict — **revocation-unknown → DENY** by the algebra
  (`vAnd(0,+1)=0`), every missing/errored/throwing factor defaults to `0`, out-of-domain side-signals throw a
  fail-closed `SecurityTrap`. Reuses `vAnd`/`allOf`/`decideAtBoundary` verbatim (no new crypto, no ASN.1/OCSP
  parsing). Adversarially verified (4 lenses: 3 clean, 1 test-coverage gap which was closed with 5 SEC-002
  mutation-guard tests). **Not yet wired into live admission (guide step 5 pending).**
- **app-kernel grew 60 → 87 tests** (kernel fail-opens fixed, b0428b0) — independently un-reflected in any doc until now.
- **4-process QA-tooling program completed**: SEC-002 mutation gate (49a1436, kills 3 B5a mutants), DOC-004
  doc-drift (57fe534), BLD-003 provenance/freshness folding #216 (285b61d); kb-index KB search (f63e3bd).
- **B8 HTTP transport UNLOCKED** by owner (f0e7236); transport/auth R&D phase closed (0c5b1c9).

## NEW ROADMAP

### NEAR (build-not-research, highest cross-dimension leverage)
- **B8 cert-gate FOLLOW-THROUGH (now #1):** wire `cert-gate.ts` into the live kernel auth path — `kernel.ts`
  `// ── 6 auth ──` (~line 307) currently just 401s on a missing `Authorization` header. Have the kernel call
  `certGate`/`decideAtBoundary` so a library-validated chain with revocation-unknown→DENY actually gates live
  admission. Until this lands, S1 hardens the path but changes no live behaviour. (Adjacent to #212.)
- **B8 0066 first-3** (carried from 2026-06-22): bind shipped admission to the TLS handshake · raw-byte shim +
  idempotency-gated 0-RTT · Recovering FSM + ECH/OHTTP. Build per `rd-absorbed/rd-tlstp-transport-auth-cluster-2026-06-22.md`.
- **#211 inbound-listener hardening** (in-scope with B8 GO): request timeout · rate-limit · body-size cap ·
  slowloris guard · honor SecurityPosture. `RateLimiter`/`parseRateLimit` already exist in
  `galerina-core-network/inbound-guard`; today the listener only does 405/404/500.
- **Apply the stale-doc fixes** (README counts/date/framework %/app-kernel 87 · AGENTS.md Phase-4 table ·
  version.json regen) + wire **#150 CI auto-count** so 5,042 stops drifting. Cheap, high-trust. *(This audit
  applies most of them.)*
- **Extend the SEC-002 mutant catalog** beyond B5a/cert-gate to fuse-loader gates 1–3 / secret-egress /
  i32-overflow, and register the cert-gate's 5 in-test mutation guards in `audit-mutation.mjs` (currently 3 B5a
  mutants only). Fix the `audit-mutation.mjs:28` `--config`-absent CLI crash.
- **#201 EFFECT-006** pii/phi brand→family map: complete + `git stash pop` (unblocks #202) — largest in-flight
  item with no commit.
- **H5 fusion-B2 ABI mismatch** (sync `invoke(i32)` → async `HandlerResult`) + one real end-to-end fused-app test.
- **Stage E diagnostic P0-security overloads** (SECRET-002/PRIVACY-002/GOV-004/MONO-001/INV-002/ASSIMILATE-002 →
  one-code-one-fault) + remove the **MEMORY-001..007 false production-blocking gate**.

### MID
- **Self-hosted Stage-B past lexer**: prove `parser.fungi → type-checker.fungi → governance-verifier.fungi` to WASM
  byte-parity via the #105 gate — the lever moving Axis-B 80%→100% (`tokenize` is the only flow at byte-parity today).
- **Close the 4 WASM codegen gaps**: #200 nested-member walker · #171 None sentinel · #172 `__int_to_str` i32
  truncation · run-host string unification.
- **0014 governance-fidelity differential harness** (graph/WASM == walker, byte-identical, fail-closed) —
  prerequisite for the lean→WASM router and extending Stage-B parity.
- **ML-DSA-65 hybrid signing** over the SHA-256 digest (#34, offline custody) — the remaining PQ gap; verify is
  PQ-ready, the `.lmanifest` signer is still standalone Ed25519.
- **#149 CI secret-scan** (gitleaks/trufflehog in a real `.github/workflows/`) + re-sign legacy old-key (8eecf4)
  artifacts — last open key-exposure P0.
- **#216 WASM build-provenance** into manifest-generator (partly delivered by BLD-003 285b61d — fold/finish) +
  **#202 transitive capability-mask ⊆** (after #201, avoid stash conflict).
- **Real runnable example-app + api-server `src/`** (today both README/TODO-only) + replace the T-008
  `assert.ok(true)` crash-containment placeholder with a same-process supervisor harness.
- **Remaining #219 enforcers** (property/differential/coverage-threshold), drive the scanner baseline 154→0
  across Stages F/G/H, then flip `lint-conventions` + scanner `--soft` → CI-enforcing (Stage J).
- **#212 kernel→runtime governance-deny bridge** (`governance_deny` KernelErrorCode + X-Galerina-State
  503/backpressure) — completes the cert-gate verdict→HTTP-response story once S1 is wired.

### LONG (owner/infra-gated + the one R&D candidate)
- **Real DSS.wasm**: stand up the Wasmtime component-model host (#102–106) — DWI guests under real per-isolate
  fuel + in-WASM receipt signing (DRCM Phase 5). The single biggest gap to a complete governed runtime.
  *(External-infra + owner gated — surface as an explicit decision, don't silently park.)*
- **R&D CANDIDATE — Z3/SMT as a "math compiler"**: QF_BV proof of tri-tier i32 conformance (replacing the
  3M-random-pairs sampling), then formalize the 0014 differential as translation-validation. Now also applicable
  to discharging the **cert-gate K3 algebra** (`cert_verdict = min of four trits`) as a *proof* rather than 22
  sampled tests.
- **#218 non-codes audit dimensions** (#217 capability/syntax · flows/deps layering · governance-rules · effects
  · contract-clause coverage) — codes is 1 of 6 planned; the path to a whole-language coverage guarantee.
- **Deferred audit residuals** (GOV-003 dataflow rename, VSC-004/005, CRYPTO-004/005/006, Gate-6 mediums/lows) +
  design-only R&D tier (#203–210, #205 Kleene-lattice unify).
- **In-sandbox TLS/isolation guarantee for B8 remains aspirational** (#102–106): the TLSTP
  "math-security-in-sandbox" / decryption-strictly-in-WASM story is a DSS.wasm-stub claim; the cert-gate is
  digital/library-validated and does **not** by itself deliver in-WASM isolation — keep labelled aspirational
  until the Wasmtime TCB lands.

## Stale-doc fixes (applied this session unless noted)
- **version.json** — regenerated via `run-all-tests.cjs --emit-counts`: testCount → 5,042, core-network 104→126,
  app-kernel 60→87, header date → 2026-06-23.
- **README.md** — counts 4,980→5,042; maturity date 2026-06-21→2026-06-23; app-kernel 60→87; framework row
  ~75%→~72% (verified weighted figure); compiler 3,679→3,684; roadmap link repointed to this doc; new
  Recent (2026-06-23) entry; cert-gate landing noted (path-hardened, kernel-wiring pending).
- **AGENTS.md** — Build Pipeline Status table corrected: Phase 4 "In progress" → Complete, Phases 5/6 "Planned" →
  Complete (Stage-A is ~100% shipped; the stale table actively misleads onboarding AI agents).
- **Still open** (tracked, not yet applied): record the cert-gate landing as a DONE row in ledger §9; physically
  delete the DONE rows (#68/#72/#76/#91/#125/#126/#128) from build-roadmap "Now Open" tables; reconcile
  build-roadmap header's third count (4,989). Full detail: task output `wnu7r6l4v.output`.
