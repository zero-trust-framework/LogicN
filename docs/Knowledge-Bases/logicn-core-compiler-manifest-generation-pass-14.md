# LogicN Core Compiler: Manifest Generation (Pass 14)

## Status

```text
Package: logicn-core-compiler
Area: manifest generation
Compiler pass: 14
Version target: v0.2
Implementation status: specified, implementation pending
Primary output: runtime-manifest.json
Related diagnostics: LLN-MANIFEST-001 through LLN-MANIFEST-005
```

This document defines the compiler manifest generation pass for LogicN Core Compiler.

Pass 14 turns the checked program, effect graph, boundary graph, route metadata, capability metadata, report metadata, and compiler diagnostics into a canonical `RuntimeManifest`.

The manifest is the governance bridge between:

```text
compiler -> CLI -> runtime -> deploy -> explain -> audit
```

It must be deterministic, hashable, machine-readable, and safe to consume by runtime and deployment tooling.

---

## Why Pass 14 Exists

Earlier compiler passes answer local questions:

```text
type checker       -> is this program type-safe?
effect checker     -> what authority does this code require?
boundary checker   -> where can data/effects safely cross?
capability resolver -> what named authority is required?
```

Pass 14 answers the deployment question:

```text
What exactly has this build proven, and what must the runtime enforce?
```

Without a runtime manifest, the compiler may understand effects and boundaries internally, but the runtime cannot reliably enforce them after compilation.

---

## Pipeline Position

```text
Pass 01 lexer
Pass 02 parser
Pass 03 AST normalisation
Pass 04 symbol binding
Pass 05 type checking
Pass 06 effect inference
Pass 07 effect propagation
Pass 08 boundary checking
Pass 09 capability resolution
Pass 10 route/API extraction
Pass 11 target compatibility planning
Pass 12 report assembly
Pass 13 audit metadata emission
Pass 14 manifest generation
```

Pass 14 must run after all metadata-producing passes have completed.

It must not invent authority. It only serialises compiler-proven metadata.

---

## RuntimeManifest v0.2

```ts
export interface RuntimeManifest {
  /** Stable schema identifier consumed by CLI/runtime/deploy tools. */
  schemaVersion: "logicn.runtime.manifest.v0.2"

  /** Unique deterministic build identifier. */
  buildId: string

  /** ISO timestamp from the build host. */
  generatedAt: string

  /** Target selected during compilation. */
  target: RuntimeTarget

  /** Route-level runtime metadata for API/server packages. */
  routes: RouteManifest[]

  /** Function-level effect, boundary, and capability metadata. */
  functions: FunctionManifest[]

  /** Global effect registry entries observed or required by this build. */
  effects: EffectManifest[]

  /** Boundary policies required by this build. */
  boundaries: BoundaryManifest[]

  /** Named permissions/capabilities required at runtime. */
  permissions: PermissionManifest[]

  /** Reports emitted by the compiler build. */
  reports: ReportManifest[]

  /** Hashes used by verify/deploy/audit tooling. */
  integrity: ManifestIntegrity

  /** Compiler diagnostics relevant to runtime governance. */
  diagnostics: CompilerDiagnostic[]
}
```

---

## RouteManifest

```ts
export interface RouteManifest {
  id: string

  /** HTTP method, e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. */
  method: string

  /** Public route path. */
  path: string

  /** Checked request type name if available. */
  requestType?: string

  /** Checked response type name if available. */
  responseType?: string

  /** Authentication policy required for this route. */
  auth?: AuthManifest

  /** Request body validation and size policy. */
  body?: BodyManifest

  /** Runtime limits: timeout, body size, rate limits, etc. */
  limits?: LimitsManifest

  /** Effects reachable from this route handler. */
  effects: string[]

  /** Boundary identifiers crossed by this route. */
  boundaries: string[]

  /** Optional webhook policy when this route is a webhook. */
  webhook?: WebhookManifest
}
```

Route manifests are consumed by:

```text
logicn-framework-api-server
logicn explain --runtime
logicn deploy --policy
OpenAPI export tooling
audit/report tooling
```

---

## FunctionManifest

```ts
export interface FunctionManifest {
  id: string
  name: string

  /** Effects explicitly written in source. */
  declaredEffects: string[]

  /** Effects inferred from AST/IR operations. */
  inferredEffects: string[]

  /** Effects inherited through the call graph. */
  transitiveEffects: string[]

  /** Boundaries crossed by this function or its callees. */
  boundaries: string[]

  /** Runtime capabilities required to execute this function. */
  capabilities: string[]

  /** Optional source location for explain/report output. */
  source?: SourceLocation
}
```

Function manifests must include transitive effects. A route or public function is only safe to deploy if the runtime can see all authority reachable below it.

---

## EffectManifest

```ts
export interface EffectManifest {
  name: string

  /** Group used by target policy and deployment policy. */
  category: string

  /** Unsafe-by-default effects require explicit capability. */
  unsafe: boolean

  /** True when the effect must be checked at API/package/runtime boundaries. */
  boundarySensitive: boolean

  /** Capability required by this effect, if any. */
  requiredCapability?: string
}
```

Example:

```json
{
  "name": "network.http.request",
  "category": "network",
  "unsafe": true,
  "boundarySensitive": true,
  "requiredCapability": "NetworkRequest"
}
```

---

## BoundaryManifest

```ts
export interface BoundaryManifest {
  id: string

  /** api, webhook, worker, job, network, database, secret, ffi, filesystem, ai. */
  type: string

  /** untrusted, validated, internal, privileged. */
  trustLevel: string

  /** Effects allowed to cross this boundary. */
  allowedEffects: string[]

  /** Effects explicitly denied at this boundary. */
  deniedEffects: string[]

  /** Policy names required before runtime execution. */
  requiredPolicies: string[]
}
```

Boundary manifests must remain fail-closed. Empty `allowedEffects` means no effect is allowed unless a higher policy explicitly grants it.

---

## BuildManifestInput

```ts
export interface BuildManifestInput {
  /** Fully checked program from earlier compiler passes. */
  checkedProgram: CheckedProgram

  /** Effect graph after iterative fixpoint propagation. */
  effectGraph: EffectGraph

  /** Boundary graph after policy validation. */
  boundaryGraph: BoundaryGraph

  /** Compiler options, target, profile, strict mode, and output paths. */
  compilerOptions: CompilerOptions

  /** Reports emitted before manifest generation. */
  reports: ReportManifest[]
}
```

Pass 14 must reject incomplete inputs. It should not create a manifest from a partially checked program.

---

## buildManifest() Reference Implementation

```ts
export function buildManifest(
  input: BuildManifestInput
): RuntimeManifest {
  assertManifestInputComplete(input)

  const manifest: RuntimeManifest = {
    schemaVersion: "logicn.runtime.manifest.v0.2",
    buildId: createBuildId(input),
    generatedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    target: input.compilerOptions.target,

    // Route metadata is optional for library packages but required for API packages.
    routes: buildRouteManifests(input),

    // Function metadata is always required because effect authority is function-scoped.
    functions: buildFunctionManifests(input),

    // Effect and boundary registries are derived from checked compiler metadata.
    effects: buildEffectManifests(input),
    boundaries: buildBoundaryManifests(input),

    // Permissions connect effects to runtime capability checks.
    permissions: buildPermissionManifests(input),

    // Report metadata lets explain/deploy/audit locate generated files safely.
    reports: input.reports,

    // Integrity is filled after stable serialisation.
    integrity: emptyManifestIntegrity(),

    diagnostics: input.checkedProgram.diagnostics
  }

  const diagnostics = validateManifest(manifest)

  return {
    ...manifest,
    diagnostics: [
      ...manifest.diagnostics,
      ...diagnostics
    ],
    integrity: buildManifestIntegrity(manifest)
  }
}
```

---

## Stable Manifest Serialisation

Manifest hashing requires deterministic output.

```ts
export function serializeManifestStable(
  manifest: RuntimeManifest
): string {
  return JSON.stringify(sortManifestKeys(manifest), null, 2) + "\n"
}
```

Rules:

```text
sort object keys
sort effects by name
sort boundaries by id
sort functions by id
sort routes by method + path
include trailing newline
never include local absolute paths unless explicitly allowed
never include raw secrets
```

---

## Manifest Integrity

```ts
export interface ManifestIntegrity {
  manifestHash: string
  graphHash: string
  effectGraphHash: string
  boundaryGraphHash: string
  reportHash: string
}
```

```ts
export function buildManifestIntegrity(
  manifest: RuntimeManifest
): ManifestIntegrity {
  const withoutIntegrity = {
    ...manifest,
    integrity: emptyManifestIntegrity()
  }

  return {
    manifestHash: sha256(serializeManifestStable(withoutIntegrity)),
    graphHash: sha256(JSON.stringify(manifest.functions)),
    effectGraphHash: sha256(JSON.stringify(manifest.effects)),
    boundaryGraphHash: sha256(JSON.stringify(manifest.boundaries)),
    reportHash: sha256(JSON.stringify(manifest.reports))
  }
}
```

---

## validateManifest()

```ts
export function validateManifest(
  manifest: RuntimeManifest
): CompilerDiagnostic[] {
  const diagnostics: CompilerDiagnostic[] = []

  if (!manifest.schemaVersion) {
    diagnostics.push({
      code: "LLN-MANIFEST-001",
      severity: "error",
      message: "Runtime manifest is missing schemaVersion."
    })
  }

  if (manifest.schemaVersion !== "logicn.runtime.manifest.v0.2") {
    diagnostics.push({
      code: "LLN-MANIFEST-003",
      severity: "error",
      message: `Unsupported runtime manifest version: ${manifest.schemaVersion}.`
    })
  }

  for (const fn of manifest.functions) {
    for (const capability of fn.capabilities) {
      if (!manifest.permissions.some(permission => permission.name === capability)) {
        diagnostics.push({
          code: "LLN-MANIFEST-004",
          severity: "error",
          message: `Function ${fn.name} references unknown capability ${capability}.`
        })
      }
    }
  }

  for (const route of manifest.routes) {
    for (const effect of route.effects) {
      if (!isEffectAllowedForTarget(effect, manifest.target)) {
        diagnostics.push({
          code: "LLN-MANIFEST-005",
          severity: "error",
          message: `Route ${route.method} ${route.path} uses effect ${effect} not supported by target ${manifest.target}.`
        })
      }
    }
  }

  return diagnostics
}
```

## CLI Integration

### logicn build

`logicn build` must write `runtime-manifest.json` as part of the build output.

```bash
logicn build --target server --out build
```

Expected output:

```text
build/manifests/runtime-manifest.json
build/reports/compiler-report.json
build/reports/effect-report.json
build/reports/boundary-report.json
```

### logicn verify

`logicn verify` must validate manifest integrity.

```bash
logicn verify --manifest build/manifests/runtime-manifest.json
```

### logicn explain

`logicn explain` should use the manifest to answer:

```text
Which functions require network?
Which route can read secrets?
Which boundary denied deployment?
Which capability is missing?
```

### logicn deploy

`logicn deploy` must fail closed if the manifest is missing, invalid, or incompatible with the selected deployment target.

## Testing Notes

```ts
describe("buildManifest", () => {
  it("includes transitive effects for each function", () => {
    const manifest = buildManifest(fixtureInput)

    expect(
      manifest.functions.find(fn => fn.name === "createUser")?.transitiveEffects
    ).toContain("database.write")
  })

  it("fails when a capability reference is missing", () => {
    const manifest = buildManifest(inputWithMissingCapability)
    const diagnostics = validateManifest(manifest)

    expect(diagnostics.some(d => d.code === "LLN-MANIFEST-004")).toBe(true)
  })
})
```

---

## Architecture Rule

Manifest generation must never widen authority.

Correct:

```text
source declaration + inferred operation + propagated call graph -> manifest authority
```

Incorrect:

```text
manifest builder guesses permission because runtime might need it
```

If metadata is incomplete, pass 14 must emit diagnostics and fail closed.
