# Galerina — Topological Graph Engine

**Version:** 1.1 (2026-06-05)  
**Purpose:** Integrates the Governed Tower with topology-aware execution enforcement.
Evolves Galerina from a deterministic sandbox into a **Topology-Aware Governance Platform**.

---

## Design Review: What Was Adapted

The source specification (notes/28 extended) proposed "vector similarity metrics for permission
requests." This was **replaced with Behavioral Fingerprinting** because:
- Vector similarity introduces non-deterministic boundaries (fuzzy cluster matching)
- The Tower's core principle: all permission decisions are O(1) binary operations (V_DPM AND)
- A pre-computed SHA-256 of the expected execution path is equally powerful, fully deterministic,
  and cryptographically auditable

eBPF LSM / dedicated MMU segments were **not adopted** because they conflict with the
Wasmtime-only TCB constraint (`PRINCIPLE: No Rust in the project; everything is .fungi → WASM`).

## The Three New Engine Components

### Component 1 — Execution DAG (Floor 3 → Floor 4 → Floor 2)

**What it is:** At compile time, the Governance Verifier constructs a DAG (Directed Acyclic
Graph) of valid execution state transitions from the flow's control flow graph + contract
constraints. This DAG is stored in `.lmanifest` as CBOR Tag 414.

**State-Space Nodes:** Every node in the DAG is defined as:
```
Node = {
  memory_snapshot: hash(linear_memory_state),
  vdpm_state:      uint32,   // current V_DPM bitmask
  proof_context:   bytes,    // active ProofObligation hashes from invariant {}
}
```

**Authorized Edges:** An edge `A → B` exists if and only if:
1. The instruction at A is permitted under `vdpm_state(A)`
2. The resulting memory and V_DPM state is provably `vdpm_state(B) ≤ vdpm_state(A)` (monotonic)
3. The transition is within the flow's declared `effects {}` set

**Unauthorized edge detection:** If DSS.wasm observes a state transition not in the DAG
(e.g., a call to `network.outbound` while on a path that was proved to be `pure`), it fires
`unreachable` immediately — the `SecurityViolation` trap. This is the second dimension of
security beyond the V_DPM bitmask check.

**CBOR Tag 414 — ExecutionDAG:**
```cbor
ExecutionDAG (Tag 414) {
  flowId:      string,
  nodeCount:   uint,
  edgeCount:   uint,
  rootNode:    uint32,   // V_DPM at entry
  edges:       array of { from: uint32, to: uint32, effect: string }
}
```

**Implementation gate:** DRCM Phase 6 (after DSS.wasm supervisor, task #41)

---

### Component 2 — MMCP: Memory-Mapped Capability Pointer (Floor 2)

**What it is:** A typed pointer that carries its own capability mask. When a DWI isolate
receives an MMCP to a memory region, the mask specifies what operations are permitted.

**The problem it solves:** Currently, memory access in WASM is bounded by linear memory
guard pages (physical impossibility of cross-isolate access). MMCPs add a *governance layer*
on top: even within a DWI's 4MB region, individual memory sub-regions have typed access rules.

**MMCP structure:**
```
MMCP = {
  base_offset:  uint32,   // offset within DWI linear memory
  length:       uint32,   // byte count
  capability:   uint32,   // bitmask: read=0x1, write=0x2, execute=0x4, secret=0x8
  owner_flow:   string,   // flow that owns this region
}
```

**Linear ownership semantics (inspired by Rust + CHERI):**
- When an MMCP is "moved" to another flow's scope, the source's access bits are cleared
- This prevents Use-After-Free and Double-Free by design
- No runtime check needed — the V_DPM update handles it atomically

**CBOR Tag 415 — CapabilityPointer:**
```cbor
CapabilityPointer (Tag 415) {
  baseOffset:   uint32,
  length:       uint32,
  capabilityMask: uint32,
  ownerFlowId:  string
}
```

**Implementation gate:** DRCM Phase 5 (alongside step keyword + DWI allocator, task #40)

---

### Component 3 — Pre-Resolved Policy DAG (Floor 3 → Floor 4)

**What it is:** During the admission gate (`galerina verify`), all `[conforms_to:]` domain
guard policy conflicts are resolved into a compact, conflict-free DAG. Stored in `.lmanifest`.
DSS.wasm loads this at startup and uses it for O(1) transition validation.

**Conflict example:**
```
Policy A: deny network.outbound
Policy B: allow storage.write (required by invoiced flow)
```
Without pre-resolution, the DSS.wasm supervisor must evaluate `deny` vs `allow` at runtime.
With pre-resolution, the DAG already contains the resolved outcome: `allowed = { storage.write },
denied = { network.outbound }`.

**Pre-resolution algorithm (Floor 3, compile time):**
1. Load all referenced domain guard policies via `[conforms_to:]` annotations
2. Build conflict graph: nodes = effects, edges = allow/deny rules from all policies
3. Resolve conflicts using precedence: `deny > allow` (deny-by-default)
4. Output conflict-free effect matrix as compact bit array
5. Store in `.lmanifest` CBOR Tag 416

**CBOR Tag 416 — PolicyResolutionDAG:**
```cbor
PolicyResolutionDAG (Tag 416) {
  allowedEffects:  uint32,  // bitmask of permitted effects for this flow
  deniedEffects:   uint32,  // bitmask of denied effects
  conflictsFound:  uint,    // number of conflicts resolved
  resolvedAt:      string   // ISO timestamp
}
```

**Status:** Can be implemented now (Task #79). Builds on existing domain guard infrastructure.

### The Adapted Element: Behavioral Fingerprinting

**Replaces:** "Vector similarity metrics for permission requests" (spec §3)  
**Why replaced:** Vector similarity is non-deterministic — cluster boundary decisions vary
between runs. This violates the Tower's O(1) binary permission guarantee.

**What Behavioral Fingerprinting does instead:**
- At compile time: hash the expected execution path (CFG hash: ordered sequence of effects)
- Store in `.lmanifest` as a `behavioralFingerprint: sha256(cfgPath)` field
- At runtime: DSS.wasm computes rolling hash of actual execution path
- If the rolling hash deviates from `behavioralFingerprint` → trigger `emergency {}` overlay

This is **deterministic, auditable, and cryptographically verifiable** — an attacker cannot
produce a hash collision without breaking SHA-256. The anomaly detection is as strong as
a probabilistic vector model, but with zero false-positive rate.

## Updated V_DPM Bit Layout (Extended for Topology)

| Bit Range | Description | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 0–7 | Core capabilities: network, storage, secret, audit, db, ai, shell, native | Capability layer |
| 8–15 | Topology flags: dag_edge_valid, mmcp_read, mmcp_write, mmcp_execute, mmcp_secret | Topology layer |
| 16–19 | Execution path: phase_0..3 (which DAG phase is active) | Path tracking |
| 20–29 | Reserved: future capability/topology families | — |
| 30 | `quarantine_engaged` | Containment |
| 31 | `emergency_mode` | Override |

**New topology-layer bits (8–15):**
- Bit 8: `dag_edge_valid` — current transition is authorized in the ExecutionDAG
- Bit 9: `mmcp_read` — the isolate has an active read-capable MMCP
- Bit 10: `mmcp_write` — the isolate has an active write-capable MMCP
- Bit 11: `mmcp_execute` — the isolate has an active execute-capable MMCP
- Bit 12: `mmcp_secret` — the isolate has an active secret-access MMCP

When Bit 8 (`dag_edge_valid`) is 0, the capability check O(1) AND operation always returns 0
regardless of other bits — **topology check runs BEFORE capability check**.

---

### `gate {}` — Admission Guard Integration

The `gate(condition)` syntax maps directly to V_DPM bit 8 (`dag_edge_valid`) in the topology layer.

At the architectural level:
1. Compiler records `gate(condition)` → `dag_check_required: true` in flow manifest
2. DSS.wasm checks bit 8 before dispatching to any flow inside a gate block
3. If bit 8 is 0 (DAG transition not authorized) → `unreachable` trap → FUNGI-INV-000 AuditEvent

The `condition` in `gate(condition)` maps to a Domain Guard Policy name. At Phase 5, the
pre-compiled decision tree from the PolicyResolutionDAG (CBOR Tag 416) is used for the O(1) lookup:

```
gate(admin_only)
    ↓
Compiler looks up 'admin_only' in knownDomainGuards
    ↓
Records { gateCondition: "admin_only", bit: 8 } in .lmanifest ProofObligation (Tag 403)
    ↓
DSS.wasm: before dispatch → V_DPM & 0x100 (bit 8) → if 0 → unreachable
```

**Stage A (now):** gate condition recorded in manifest; bit 8 check deferred to Phase 5.  
**Phase 5 (DSS.wasm):** real `(if (i32.eqz (i32.and (global.get $vdpm) (i32.const 256))) (then unreachable))` emitted.

**Governance rules:** `FUNGI-GATE-001` (unknown condition), `FUNGI-GATE-002` (gate on pure flow)
