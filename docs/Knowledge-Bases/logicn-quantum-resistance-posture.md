# LogicN Quantum-Resistance Posture (Zero-Trust)

**Status:** governance posture + decision record. **Date:** 2026-06-15.
**Principle (the rule):** *Make LogicN quantum-resistant **where it can reasonably be done** — where the
threat is real and the cost is amortized (cold paths) — **without hammering hot-path performance** for
marginal benefit.*

> **Forward-looking standard:** the multi-level (L0–L4) quantum-resilience ladder, the QKD/QRNG/QDS photonic
> lanes, the Lane-E hybrid `KDF(K_pqc ‖ K_qkd)` combiner, and the Q0–Q4 roadmap that build *on top of* this
> posture now live in `logicn-quantum-resilience-roadmap.md` (absorbed from R&D). Verbatim R&D sources are under
> `rd-absorbed/`; the full ledger is `logicn-rd-absorption-catalog.md`.

## Threat model — what a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer (CRQC) actually breaks
- **Shor's algorithm → asymmetric / public-key** (RSA, ECDSA, **Ed25519**): *polynomial-time* break —
  the private key is recoverable from the public key. **This is the real quantum threat.**
- **Grover's algorithm → symmetric + hashes** (AES, **SHA-256**): only a *quadratic* speedup. SHA-256's
  ~2²⁵⁶ preimage work drops to ~2¹²⁸ — still infeasible. NIST treats SHA-256 as quantum-acceptable.

## The rules / decisions

### R1 — Integrity hash: **KEEP SHA-256.** *(DECISION: do NOT change or replace it.)*
SHA-256 (FIPS 180-4) is **already quantum-resistant** — Grover leaves 128-bit security, which is
acceptable. Replacing it buys **zero** quantum benefit while costing reproducible-build determinism,
interop, and FIPS posture. "Replace SHA-256 with a signature/lattice scheme" (the rejected TMX proposal,
`notes/31–34`) is a **category error** — a hash and a signature do different jobs, and the quantum risk is
on the *signature*, not the *hash*. If a higher hash margin is ever required, escalate to **SHA-384/512** —
**never** to a signature scheme. **Reasonable-cost: no change = no cost.** ✅

### R2 — Signatures: **migrate to post-quantum (ML-DSA-65).** *(The genuine PQ work — #34.)*
**Ed25519** (the live signature today) is **Shor-breakable** → a CRQC could forge manifest signatures and
fake supply-chain provenance ("harvest-now, **forge**-later" for long-lived artifacts). The remedy is
**ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204) signing over the same SHA-256 digest**, **hybrid Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65** during
transition (defense-in-depth: secure if *either* scheme holds). Cost is **once-per-build** (a cold path) →
reasonable. Conservative backup: **SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, hash-based)** — Stage-2 option noted in `attestation.ts`. ✅

**Status (corrected 2026-06-16 — was overstated as "to finish"):** the hybrid algorithm is **SHIPPED for
the ProofGraph governance signature** (Phase 55: `generateHybridGovernanceKeyPair`, `signProofGraphHybrid`,
`verifyGovernanceSignatureHybrid` in `proof-graph.ts`, via `@noble/post-quantum` `ml_dsa65` — a real
dependency, not "planned"). Signature tiers: `lln.gov.sig.v1` (Ed25519, compat) → `v2` (hybrid, both
required) → `v3` (pq_strict, future). It was **untested until 2026-06-16** (`tests/hybrid-pq-signature.test.mjs`,
proves round-trip + fail-closed + both-required).

**#34 ATTESTATION SURFACES — COMPLETED 2026-06-16 (commit 28ea755):** the audit `attestation.ts` and bridge
`bridge-attestation.ts` surfaces are now **hybrid Ed25519+ML-DSA-65** too (`signAttestationHybrid`/
`verifyAttestationHybrid`; `signManifestHybrid`/`verifyAttestationHybrid`; `BridgeAttestation` gained an
optional `mlDsaSignature`; tower-citizen took `@noble/post-quantum`). All three surfaces now bind a **per-surface
FIPS-204 domain-separation context** (`logicn.proofgraph.governance.v1` / `.audit.attestation.v1` /
`.bridge.manifest.v1`) so one ML-DSA key can't be cross-protocol-confused between them — empirically verified
that a wrong/absent context fails verification. **Downgrade hardening DONE:** the sync `verifyGovernanceSignature`
now **rejects v2 outright** (was validating only the Ed25519 half); all hybrid verifiers require BOTH halves and
reject a v1 sig. Pure ML-DSA over the digest/pre-image (not HashML-DSA), per the .tmf TASK-2 custody spec.
Tests: `attestation-hybrid.test.mjs` (+8), `bridge-attestation-hybrid.test.mjs` (+6), `hybrid-pq-signature` v2-reject.

**Remaining #34 gate:** only **production key custody** (long-lived signing-key storage/rotation in HSM/KMS,
revocation⇒AuthError, out-of-band PKI for public keys — relates to `#149`). The algorithm + all signing surfaces
are done. Candidate enforcement `LLN-CRYPTO-PQ-001` (a `Sign` effect must declare a PQ/hybrid alg) still recorded.

### R3 — Key exchange / encryption: **ML-KEM only if/when confidentiality is added.**
LogicN does **not** encrypt artifacts today (manifests are *signed*, not encrypted), so there is **no
"harvest-now-decrypt-later" exposure now.** If confidential data-at-rest/in-transit is ever added, use
**ML-KEM (FIPS 203)**. Not currently needed. ⏸

### R4 — "Reasonable cost" guardrail (the performance limit).
PQ measures live on **cold paths** (build-time signing, attestation, admission) where the cost amortizes.
**Do NOT PQ-harden per-request hot paths** for marginal benefit. (Corollary, from the GateCache analysis:
a *cache key* is **not** security crypto and must stay cheap — not even SHA-256 there, let alone ML-DSA.)

### R5 — Crypto-on-core complement *(already enforced — `LLN-SUBSTRATE-001`).*
Integrity / `Hash` / `Sign` effects must run on a **deterministic, bit-exact** lane. A PQ signature is
worthless if computed on a non-bit-exact substrate, so the PQ posture (R1–R2) and the substrate posture
reinforce each other.

## Enforcement (BUILT 2026-06-16)
**`LLN-CRYPTO-PQ-001` — IMPLEMENTED** (governance-verifier, certified profiles): a `crypto.sign` effect must
declare a PQ/hybrid algorithm via a marker effect from the allowlist — `crypto.sign.hybrid` /
`crypto.sign.mldsa65` / `crypto.sign.slhdsa`. Bare `crypto.sign` or a classical-only `crypto.sign.ed25519`
is **denied (error)** in `production`/`deterministic` profiles (deny-by-default), allowed in `dev`. The marker
is declared alongside the base effect: `effects { crypto.sign crypto.sign.hybrid }` (base handles call-matching;
marker asserts the algorithm — no parser change, dotted effects already parse). This makes the R2 posture
machine-checked. Companion: **`LLN-SUBSTRATE-001` (crypto-on-core) now also covers `crypto.encrypt/decrypt/seal`**
(KEM-DEM/AEAD) — all crypto effects are held to a deterministic bit-exact lane.

## Net decision
**KEEP SHA-256 (R1).** Spend the quantum-resistance budget on the **signature** (R2 — finish ML-DSA-65,
#34), on **cold paths only** (R4). That is the **maximum quantum resistance reasonably achievable without
a performance regression** — which is exactly the zero-trust posture asked for.
