# Galerina Checkpoint — Full Audit / Tests / Benchmarks / %-Audit / Roadmap (2026-06-06)

> Consolidation document for the requested checkpoint pass. Captures the verified
> test/audit/benchmark results, a completion %-audit, the forward roadmap, and the
> design decisions extracted from `notes/30-notes1..3.md` + the latest directives so
> they are recorded in the KB (not lost in long chat history). Scope: **Galerina only**
> — the TritMesh DB / `.tmf` format is a *separate* project (awareness section §8.5).

## 1. Test results (standards gate) — ✅ ALL GREEN

| Suite | Result | Command |
|---|---|---|
| **Full (all packages)** | **44/44 packages · 4,171 tests · 0 fail** | `node scripts/run-all-tests.cjs` |
| Core (SOT four) | 4/4 · 3,445 tests · 0 fail | `node scripts/run-all-tests.cjs --core` |
| Compiler (this session's focus) | 3,321 tests · 0 fail (≈ +40 vs pre-session) | `node --test` in galerina-core-compiler |
| Tower-citizen | 106 · 0 fail | (full run) |

Every per-package `tsc --noEmit` typecheck (the real "lint" gate) passes as part of each
package's test script. **Standards met.**

**Tooling fix this pass:** `scripts/run-all-tests.js` (CommonJS `require`) was stale and
broke under the root `package.json`'s `"type":"module"` — the `package.json` scripts
already pointed at `run-all-tests.cjs` (which works). Removed the stale `.js` to stop the
confusion. (This was a leftover from the #155 root-package work.)

## 2. Security audit — ✅ STANDARDS MET

| Target | Result |
|---|---|
| **Curated `examples/auth-service/` corpus (31 files)** | **31/31 clean · 0 findings** (profile strict, governance dev) |
| `#105` WASM admission gate | attestation-first, fail-closed; new negative-path tasks tracked (#173/#176/#186/#190) |

The security `audit` CLI is a *manual* devtools tool. A broad sweep over **all 397 `.fungi`**
files surfaces ~47 "failures" that are **by-design, not defects** (documented in the
toolchain memory): PROFILE-001/002 on the self-hosted compiler + recursion/loop benchmarks
(strict profile forbids recursion/unbounded loops — inherent to those algorithms),
PARSE/SYNTAX on future-syntax demos, and intentional error-demo files. The curated corpus
(the asserted gate) is clean.

## 3. Do tests + audit cover the new changes? — ✅ YES

Every WASM-lowering feature added since the P9 tokenize-parity milestone has a **dedicated
real-WASM regression test** (compiled → wabt → #105 gate → executed → asserted):

| Change | Test file |
|---|---|
| tokenize byte-parity (Stage-A == Stage-B), 21-input corpus inc. strings/chars/comments/escapes | `wat-p9-tokenize-parity.test.mjs` |
| tokenize executes through #105 gate | `wat-p9-tokenize-execution.test.mjs` |
| type-directed host fns (str_eq / unwrap_or / char_to_string / array_contains_str / classifiers) | `wat-host-stdlib-oracle.test.mjs` |
| enum-variant match dispatch (#168) | `wat-enum-match.test.mjs` |
| Result Ok/Err + guard `when` match (#164) | `wat-result-match.test.mjs` |
| host String methods (#162) | `wat-string-methods.test.mjs` |
| `#record-update` (#163) | `wat-record-update.test.mjs` |

## 4. Benchmarks — ✅ RAN CLEAN · baseline recorded

Ran `npm run run:quick` + `npm run compare` in `galerina-devtools-benchmarks`. Results
recorded at `results/latest.json` (the future-comparison baseline).

**Did this session change benchmark numbers? No material change — and that is expected.**
This session's work was entirely in the **Stage-B WASM emitter** (the `.fungi → WAT` path)
and the `#105` admission harness. The benchmark suite exercises the **Stage-A tiered
runtime** (cache / bytecode-VM / sync fast-path / WASM / tree-walker) on numeric/string/
governance workloads — a different code path. So the emitter changes neither helped nor
regressed the benchmarked hot paths; the suite ran clean and is recorded as the current
baseline. There IS a `tri-logic` benchmark (balanced-ternary trit arithmetic) already in
the suite — see §8.3 (XOR) for the ternary-gate gap it does *not* yet cover.

> Action recorded: re-run `run:quick` + `compare` at the next phase boundary and diff
> against `results/latest.json`; a real perf delta only appears once the caching work
> (§8.2) or the Stage-B-as-primary-runtime work lands.

## 5. Completion %-audit (honest)

| Area | % | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Stage-A compiler/runtime/governance engine | **production-grade** | 44/44 packages, 4,171 tests, curated audit clean |
| Governance pipeline (lexer→…→GIR, 18 rule categories) | ~100% | all rule categories enforced in Stage-A |
| Signing (Ed25519 + ML-DSA-65) | ~100% shipped | **caveat:** `.lmanifest` body signatures are placeholder (#180); key still in git history (#149) |
| Stage-B self-hosting — interpreter parity (R6 corpus) | ~100% (subset) | Stage-A == Stage-B on the 5 reference flows |
| **Stage-B self-hosting — WASM byte-parity** | **`tokenize` = 100%**; parser/type-checker/governance-verifier = **0% but prerequisites cleared** | the parity-extension cluster (#161–#169) lowered every language feature those flows need |
| Governed Tower (Brain/Brawn, sentinels, V_DPM, numeric policy) | ~85% Stage-A | DSS.wasm is Stage-A *simulation*; real Wasmtime DSS = #102–#104 |
| AI Inference Tower (BitNet/T-MAC bridges) | ~12% | native path dead; governance gates partially wired (#181–#184) |
| App-layer / framework packages | **templates, not implemented** (#154) | present Galerina as a compiler/runtime engine, not a finished app platform |

**Headline:** Galerina is a **production-grade governed compiler/runtime engine** with a
**proven self-hosting bootstrap** (the language's own lexer compiles to real WASM and
produces byte-identical output to the interpreter). The remaining self-hosting work is
mechanical (extend WASM parity from `tokenize` to the parser/checker flows — prerequisites
done), and the Tower's hardware-isolation layer is honestly disclosed as Stage-A simulation.

## 6. Roadmap (forward view)

### Critical path — extend WASM byte-parity to the parser
1. **#165** float arithmetic → `f64` ops + `f64` locals.
2. **#192** parser: `match` in expression position (`return match …` / `let x = match …`).
3. **#193** WAT emitter param-naming collision (`p0`/`p1`/… vs positional `$p<i>`).
4. Then: attempt `parser.fungi` → real-WASM byte-parity (the next milestone after tokenize).

### Security & integrity (sequence ASAP)
- **#149 CRITICAL** — signing-key git-history scrub + CI secret scanning (user-driven, destructive).
- **#173** bind certified-profile into the `#105` admission signature pre-image.
- **#176/#186** import-closure validation + attestation freshness/revocation + negative tests.
- **#153/#167** fail-closed hardening (taint default, `triToBool`, emitter placeholder fallbacks).
- **#180** real ML-DSA-65 `.lmanifest` signing (placeholder today).

### Performance (user priority — "sooner rather than later") — see §8.2
- **#194** caching of logic/governance for speed (cache compiled evaluators; never final
  decisions — zero-trust invariant). Design per Galerina's `flow`+`contract` model.

### Architecture (user directives)
- **#195** OS/Hardware-compromised posture `off | auto | on` (default `auto`, fail-secure) — §8.1.
- **Zero Trust Framework** umbrella + security bar — every component must warrant the badge — §8.7.
- ~~#196 ternary XOR~~, ~~#197 Zig~~, ~~#198 framework~~ — **not adopted** (notes discussion /
  Zig-rejected); Galerina stays a TypeScript-like `flow`+`contract` language.

### Post-P9 (already tracked)
- #102–#104 real Wasmtime DSS.wasm + DWI fuel; #146–#148, #156–#158; #181–#184 Tower gates.

---

## 7. Tasks from this checkpoint (after the "notes = discussion only" correction)
- **#194** caching of logic/governance for speed — ✅ kept (user priority; §8.2).
- **#195** OS/HW-compromised `off|auto|on` posture (default `auto`) — ✅ kept (user; §8.1).
- **Zero Trust Framework** umbrella + security bar — ✅ governing principle (§8.7).
- ~~#196 ternary XOR~~ — ❌ cancelled (notes discussion; binary XOR already covered).
- ~~#197 Zig~~ — ❌ rejected (user: do not add Zig).
- ~~#198 framework/fused-layer~~ — ❌ cancelled (notes discussion; Galerina stays flow+contract).
- (still live, pre-notes: #192 match-as-expr parser, #193 param-naming collision.)
- **Cleanup done:** removed stale `run-all-tests.js`; fixed 2 broken settings.json refs;
  renamed `mark-core-change.js`/`run-core-tests.js` → `.cjs`.

## 8. Directives

> **⚠️ The `notes/30-notes*.md` files are DISCUSSION ONLY.** Their code examples were
> AI-written *without* understanding Galerina's real syntax/semantics and are **NOT adopted**.
> **Galerina remains a TypeScript-like language using `flow` + `contract`** — no architectural
> swap, no `framework.endpoint(...)`/"Citadel"/`.passport.ln`/object-pooling/photonic models.
> Only items the **user directed in their own words** are tracked below (§8.1 OS/HW posture,
> §8.2 caching priority, §8.4 Zig-rejection) + the new **Zero Trust Framework** umbrella
> (§8.7). The framework/middleware (§8.6) and ternary-XOR (§8.3) material is recorded as
> *discussion, not adopted*.

### 8.1 OS / Hardware treated as compromised → `off | auto | on` (default `auto`)  [#195]  ✅ user directive
**Directive:** the runtime's "treat the OS and hardware as though compromised" posture must
be a tri-state setting, defaulting to `auto`.

**Decision / design:**
- `off` — trust the host OS/hardware (dev/testing, trusted single-tenant). Skip the
  expensive containment ceremonies (guard-page canaries, V_DPM re-checks on every hop,
  hardware-attestation gating). Fastest; lowest assurance.
- `auto` (**default**) — the runtime *detects* its environment and decides: enable full
  containment when it sees a hostile/multi-tenant/edge/attestation-failing context;
  relax to lightweight checks on a verified-trusted host. This is the "attritable edge"
  posture from the notes (assume nodes get captured) applied adaptively.
- `on` — always assume the OS/hardware is hostile: full DRCM containment, V_DPM bitmask
  gating on every capability use, guard-page canaries, hardware-TPM-backed audit, no
  ambient trust. Slowest; max assurance (regulated/edge/CT deployments).

**Where it lives:** a runtime/governance config knob (extends `galerina-core-config`), read
by the DSS supervisor + the `#105` admission gate + the Tower hot path. `auto` must be
*fail-secure*: if detection is uncertain, behave as `on`. Document in the governance-rules
KB and the DRCM KB. **Status: design recorded; implementation = #195.**

### 8.2 Caching logic / governance for speed  [#194]  ✅ user directive ("do sooner")
The user wants caching of logic/governance for performance. The **zero-trust security
invariant** (independent of any notes wording): cache the **compiled evaluator** (the
already-shipped #140 branchless numeric policy table / V_DPM mask program) — safe because it
re-runs against current context every call — but **NEVER cache a final allow/deny decision**
(that would bypass downstream contextual checks: target-state change, capability revocation,
posture escalation = a privilege-escalation footgun, incompatible with the Zero Trust bar
§8.7). Invalidate on any policy/posture/semantics change; roll out shadow-mode first
(log-only) before enforcing. **Design per Galerina's real `flow`+`contract` model; #194.**

### 8.3 XOR coverage  [#196]
**Question: "Have we covered XOR?"**
- **Binary XOR: ✅ covered.** The Galerina `^` operator lowers to `i32.xor`
  (`wat-emitter.ts` BINARY_OP_TO_WAT). Bitwise XOR is also used incidentally (xorshift PRNG
  in `hybrid-engine.ts`; V_DPM mask complement in `vdpm.fungi`).
- **Ternary tri-logic XOR (the "SUM gate", Mod-3): not implemented — but this is notes
  discussion, NOT adopted.** The Tower's `tpl-simulator.ts` has the T-MAC ternary dot
  product (add/subtract/skip) and a `tri-logic` benchmark, but no ternary XOR gate. The
  notes' photonic/ternary-XOR framing is exploratory; **#196 cancelled.** The actual
  question ("have we covered XOR") is answered above: binary XOR ✅.

### 8.4 "Zig-ready" — ❌ REJECTED (2026-06-06 user directive)
`notes/30-notes1.md` explored adding **Zig as a unified IR** for WASM + native. **The user
explicitly directed: "Do NOT add Zig to this project."** → **Decision: rejected. #197
deleted. WASM + the native Galerina target stay as-is; no Zig IR.** Recorded so the idea is
not re-proposed.

### 8.6 Framework / "remove middleware" (notes-2 §3686–3971) — ❌ DISCUSSION ONLY, NOT adopted
The notes' "Language-Framework Hybrid / Fused Compilation Layer / Citadel / object-pooling /
`framework.endpoint(...)`" material is **exploratory AI discussion, not a Galerina spec** —
the user clarified it was discussion only and that the notes' code examples don't reflect
real Galerina. **Not adopted; #198 and the `galerina-framework-fused-layer.md` doc were
deleted.** The `galerina-framework-*` packages remain scaffolds tracked by #154; Galerina stays
a TypeScript-like `flow`+`contract` language. (The scaffolds' OWN README/TODO design — a
manifest of routes with declared policies — is a separate, real, in-package design to honour
*if/when* #154 is built; it is not driven by the notes.)

### 8.7 Zero Trust Framework — umbrella + security bar  ✅ user directive
Galerina and its sibling parts now live under a project umbrella called **"Zero Trust
Framework."** This is a **governing security standard, not a code change**: every component
must be secure enough to warrant the zero-trust badge — deny-by-default, no ambient
authority, explicit capability, fail-closed, actor-aware audit, treat OS/hardware as
potentially compromised (ties directly to §8.1). New work is measured against this bar.
Recorded as a top-level principle; fold into the architecture-charter / governance-rules KB.

### 8.5 `.tmf` / TritMesh — separate project (awareness only)
`notes/30-notes-3.md` defines **`.tmf` (TritMesh Format)** — a balanced-ternary + NVFP4
universal tensor-mesh file container, part of the **TritMesh DB** project (Apache-2.0 core
+ BSL-1.1 cache). Per the user's instruction, this is a **separate project**; Galerina should
be *aware* of the ternary/NVFP4 lineage (shared with the Tower's T-MAC kernel and #158
quantization plugin) but **not implement `.tmf` here now**. The folders
`Galerina-ScientificPapers`, `Galerina-Patens`, `Galerina-TritMesh` are reserved for later
documentation (the user will request it explicitly — not now).

## 9. KB-documentation completeness check
The major changes this session are now documented across: this checkpoint doc, the task
ledger (`galerina-task-ledger.md` §3/§3b, #161–#193), the SOT (`galerina-runtime-status-SOT.md`,
3,322 compiler count + parity row), the roadmap (`galerina-roadmap.md`), the tech-debt review
(`galerina-techdebt-gaps-review.md`, #161–#191), and memory (`reference-galerina-runtime-status-sot.md`).
Design directives §8.1–8.4 are recorded here and cross-referenced into the roadmap; they
should also be folded into the governance-rules + DRCM KBs when #194/#195/#196/#197 are
scheduled.
