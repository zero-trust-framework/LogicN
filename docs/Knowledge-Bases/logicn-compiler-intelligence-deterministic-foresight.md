# LogicN — Deterministic Compiler Intelligence & Tri-Pipe Routing (R&D)

> Owner's R&D blueprint ("R&D Document 005", 2026-06-23), captured + mapped against shipped code (verify-before-build).
> **The thesis: "intelligence" = Deterministic Mathematical Foresight, NOT black-box AI guessing.** In an Absolute
> Zero-Trust architecture, *guessing is a fatal vulnerability.* The compiler does not guess what code will do; it
> **mathematically proves the boundaries of the code before it executes**, and routes/heals deterministically.

## The three pillars (owner's blueprint)

1. **Kleene K3 Abstract Interpretation (static trust analysis).** Map every variable in the execution DAG to the
   verdict domain `V = {−1, 0, +1}`; traverse the AST applying `vAnd = min` statically. If a downstream capability
   depends on input A (`+1`, pinned sig) AND input B (`−1`, revoked cert), the compiler proves `E = min(+1,−1) = −1`
   **at compile-time** and performs **Governance Dead-Code Elimination** — it refuses to emit WASM for the
   downstream branch, replacing it with a static `TRAP → ERASE`. It proves the failure instead of waiting for runtime.
2. **Tri-Pipe Substrate Routing (physics-aware scheduling).** A deterministic routing function `R(o)` assigns each
   operation to a substrate `{S_B Binary, S_H Hybrid, S_P Photonic}`. **Rule 1 (crypto invariant):**
   `R(o_crypto) = S_B` rigidly (hashing/KDF/exact-indexing stay Binary). **Rule 2 (photonic promotion):** massive
   parallel tensor multiply where precision-loss is acceptable → `S_P`. **Substrate contamination:** a tensor (`S_P`)
   result used as an AES key (`S_B`) is proven illegal (analog noise cannot cross into a bit-exact field) → immediate
   `LLN-SUBSTRATE-001` compile error before `.wasm` is generated.
3. **Semantic Auto-Resilience (injecting the `0` state).** On a network call (`db.fetch`) the compiler rewrites it
   into a ternary state machine — `+1` verified · `0` noise-detected (request Ternary Symbol Repair, holding pattern)
   · `−1` signature-invalid (TRAP) — so a forgotten `try/catch` becomes a physics-aware fault-tolerant machine
   automatically, without the developer writing one.

## Verify-before-build mapping (what already ships vs net-new)

| Pillar | Shipped today | Net-new / under-explored |
|---|---|---|
| §2 K3 abstract interpretation → **Governance DCE** | governance-verifier proves contracts at compile-time; AOT const-fold/branch-fold/DCE (R&D 0036) | **A formal per-variable trust-state abstract-interpretation pass over the K3 lattice + DCE of provably-DENY branches (`TRAP→ERASE`) is the genuine net-new intelligence.** This is the R&D focus. |
| §3 Tri-Pipe substrate routing | `tri-pipe/execution-router.ts`, `photonic-emulator/partition-decider.ts` + `photonic-switch.ts`, `tower-citizen/hybrid-engine.ts` + `precision-strategy.ts`, `hardware-tier/tier-loader.ts`, `routePrecision` | mostly **BUILT**; gap = the *agency policy* (below) + a unified compile-time `R(o)` surfacing |
| §3 crypto invariant + contamination | `substrate-inference.ts`, `substrate-math.ts`, `LLN-SUBSTRATE-001..004`, `verifySubstrate` (governance-verifier) | mostly **BUILT**; confirm the `S_P→S_B` key-contamination case is explicitly a hard error |
| §4 semantic auto-resilience | `resilience-inference.ts` (resilience{} auto-by-default); `on_*_fault` handlers (R&D 0017) | `on_*_fault` **doesn't parse yet** (◑); the photonic-noise→`0`→Ternary-Symbol-Repair holding pattern is net-new |

**Headline: ~70-80% of the blueprint re-derives shipped architecture** (the recurring pattern). The high-value R&D
is **§2 Governance Dead-Code Elimination** — a static K3 abstract-interpretation pass that elides provably-DENY code.

## The agency question (owner asked) + recommendation

*Should the substrate router auto-promote heavy math to Photonic if the hardware is available, or must the developer
explicitly authorize it (`substrate { photonic }`)?*

**Recommendation: bounded agency — explicit authorization of the ENVELOPE, automatic routing WITHIN it, fail-closed
to Binary.** The developer opts in at the contract (`substrate { photonic }` / a tolerance+precision declaration);
the compiler's PartitionDecider then auto-routes eligible kernels to the photonic lane **only** when it proves a
**net-win + tolerance-witness + Freivalds cheap-verify + attestation**, and **never** promotes crypto / exact-index /
precision-sensitive ops. Silent auto-promotion is rejected: it violates *"no hidden power, no hidden cost"* and the
determinism contract (photonic is lossy/noisy). This is exactly the standing **Tri-Pipe coverage rule**
([[feedback-tri-pipe-coverage-rule]]) — Binary is the default+correct; Hybrid/Photonic only for eligible kernels
behind the decider, fail-closed to Binary. So the blueprint's §3 "compiler intelligently promotes tensor → S_P"
should read **"auto-routes within the developer-authorized, tolerance-witnessed envelope."**

## R&D results (workflow `w2gzcbx9d`, 4 lenses, 2026-06-23)

**Verdict: all pillars `design-then-build` — sound to build as Deterministic Foresight. No pillar is "guessing"
(deterministic total transfer functions; unknown → `0` → keep). The adversarial lens confirms over-elision is the
one fatal risk and it is structurally mitigated.**

### §2 Governance Dead-Code Elimination — high-value net-new (design complete)
~75% of the substrate is reusable: the K3 lattice/`vAnd`/`allOf`, the value-fold DCE (`foldToInt`/`foldToBool` + the
R&D-0036 `ifStmt` elision at wat-emitter.ts:1623-1651), static-truth proving (`tryStaticEval` → LLN-INV-001), the
`unreachable` TRAP→ERASE primitive, `analyzeFlowDependencies`, and the revocation/pin trust inputs
(package-resolver.ts:162-202). The ~25% net-new is a **formal K3 trust-dataflow abstract-interpretation pass**:
- **Lattice:** K3 verdict lattice `DENY ⊑ INDET ⊑ ALLOW`; per-variable `σ: Var→V`; conjunctive meet = `min` = `vAnd` (REUSE).
- **Transfer fns (monotone, total):** cert/key ref → admission verdict (pinned-sig `+1` · revoked/throws `−1` · unknown `0`); `vAnd` → `min`; a value derived from a `−1` source by any pure op stays `−1` (taint-monotone — trust can't be manufactured upward); **any unknown node → `0`, never `+1`**.
- **Join (the soundness crux):** elide a branch **iff** its guard is provably `−1` on **ALL** paths — i.e. `max`-over-paths of the guard `== −1`. A single `0`/`+1` path forces `max ≥ 0 → KEEP`. *(Two lattice directions: `min`/`vAnd` within a path for evidence; `max` across paths for elision — unit-test with a diamond CFG.)*
- **Fixpoint:** monotone worklist, lattice height 3 → terminates trivially, no widening.
- **Emission:** `(unreachable) ;; LLN-GDCE-001 TRAP→ERASE` (REUSE) + a non-silent verifier diagnostic **`LLN-GDCE-001`** (analogous to LLN-INV-001). Both tiers take the same K3 branch → preserves 0014 parity.
- **Only elide on STRUCTURAL/monotone `−1`** (revoked-at-build or a contract-contradiction that can never become `+1`), never a merely-currently-`0` verdict — avoids baking in a stale dynamic verdict.

### §3 Routing + agency — routing maths ~85% built; 2 net-new gaps
`R(o)` (Binary/Hybrid/Photonic on net-win + tolerance + Freivalds) is largely shipped. Net-new:
**(3a)** there is **no `substrate { photonic }` envelope keyword** (parser + substrate-inference accept only
lane/tolerance/redundancy) — the bounded-agency authorization surface needs it; **(3b)** contamination
(LLN-SUBSTRATE-001) is **effect-declaration-level, not value-level taint** — it doesn't track a photonic *value*
flowing into a crypto op. Agency verdict confirmed: **bounded (explicit envelope + auto-route within, fail-closed to
Binary)**; precision/crypto → photonic is "NOT POSSIBLE today and must stay so."

### §4 Auto-resilience — ~80% unbuilt; net-new = the wrapping transform
Net-new: the AST→GIR transform wrapping an effectful op in the K3 holding pattern + the 0-state semantics. Two
fail-closed-by-design risks: the holding `0` must carry a **hard deadline → 0→DENY on expiry** (never 0→ALLOW); and
a naive 0→retry on `database.write`/`gateway.charge` **doubles the mutation** → gated by the idempotency requirement.

### Build items (design-complete → engineering, logged in the outstanding catalog)
1. **§2 Governance DCE pass** (`LLN-GDCE-001`) — the headline net-new.
2. **§3a** `substrate { photonic }` envelope keyword + bounded-agency authorization surface.
3. **§3b** value-level substrate-taint (photonic value → crypto op).
4. **§4** auto-resilience AST→GIR wrapping transform + 0-state deadline→DENY semantics.

> Photonic perf = projected/emulated. Crypto/keys Binary everywhere. All four = `design-then-build`, not more R&D.
