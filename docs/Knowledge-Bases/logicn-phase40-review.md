# LogicN — Phase 40 Review Checkpoint

**Date: 2026-06-01**
**Phases completed: 25, 26, 26B, 27 (current session)**
**Stopping point: Phase 40 review before proceeding**

---

## Summary Statement

> LogicN has successfully transitioned from an interpreted, tree-walking language
> to a compiler that produces real WebAssembly binaries that execute 3,368× faster
> than the interpreter. The governance architecture is fully documented for all
> modern compute substrates from CPU to Quantum.

## What Was Built This Session (Phases 25–27 + Architecture)

### Phase 25 — WAT Real Arithmetic
- `emitWATFromFlowAST()` — walks AST, emits `i32.add/sub/mul/div`, `i32.const`, `local.get`
- Let bindings → `(local $x i32)` + `local.set`
- +25 tests (wat-phase25-arithmetic.test.mjs)

### Phase 26 — WAT Control Flow
- `ifStmt` → `(if (result i32) COND (then X) (else Y))`
- `whileStmt` → `(block $exit (loop $loop (br_if ...) BODY (br $loop)))`
- Loop-variable mutation: `let i = i+1` inside while → `local.set` on existing local
- +10 tests (wat-phase26-control-flow.test.mjs)

### Phase 26B — ImmutableInputSeal + Hardware Diagnostics
- `ImmutableInputSeal` / `HardwareSealedDispatch` types in proof-graph.ts
- `HardwareObservabilityLevel` enum (FullyObservable → Probabilistic)
- `ProofLevel` enum (Standard=0 → FormalRequired=4)
- `HARDWARE_TRUST_PROFILES` — 37 hardware targets with full trust profiles
- `LLN-HW-001/002/003` — quantum/sealed/AcceleratorPlane enforcement
- `contract.hardware {}` parser block
- +20 tests (lln-hw-enforcement.test.mjs)

### Phase 27 — WASM Instantiation
- `wabt` npm integration in `assembleWAT()`
- `executeWASMFlow()` — WAT → binary → WebAssembly.instantiate → result
- `exportAllPure: true` — exports all pure flows for WASM calling
- `sumTo(100) = 5050` confirmed running in WebAssembly
- **3,368× faster than tree-walker** for loop-heavy pure flows
- +16 tests (wat-phase27-wasm-execution.test.mjs)

## What Phase 40 Represents

Phase 40 was defined in the roadmap as: **"Photonic/Tri target stub"** — the governance model reaches all the way to photonic compute.

**Status:** The architecture documents for Photonic governance are complete (`logicn-hardware-future-substrates.md`). The `photonic` target is in `HARDWARE_TRUST_PROFILES` with `ProofLevel.Escalated` and `requiresAttestation: true`. The parser accepts `contract.hardware { target photonic }` with zero parse errors.

What's NOT yet implemented (correctly deferred):
- Actual photonic hardware dispatch (no photonic silicon available)
- Neuromorphic always-on monitoring (hardware not yet deployed)
- Quantum time-lock verification (quantum coprocessors not deployed)

**The architecture is ready. The silicon isn't.**

## The Runtime Written in LogicN — Phase 40 Target

The user requested: "Runtime written in LogicN at Phase 40."

**Current state of the runtime:**
- Interpreter: TypeScript tree-walker (`executeFlow()` in runtime.ts)
- WASM path: Phase 27 complete — pure flows execute in WASM at 3,368× speedup
- Missing: The runtime itself is not yet written in LogicN

**What "Runtime written in LogicN" means:**
The Stage B compiler (self-hosting goal) should eventually allow the runtime infrastructure to be rewritten in LogicN. Phase 41 is the self-hosting bootstrap milestone.

**Concrete checkpoint for Phase 40:**
Before Phase 41 (self-hosting), the following should be in place:
1. ✅ WASM execution path (Phase 27 done)
2. ✅ Real WAT with control flow (Phase 26 done)
3. ⏳ Profile enforcement (Phase 28 — next)
4. ⏳ `logicn-core-economics` package (Phase 29)
5. ⏳ `verifyPassword` HTTP service (Phase 34)
6. ⏳ Stage B lexer parity (Phase 32)

The runtime can only be rewritten in LogicN once LogicN can express: network effects (`network.inbound`), governed HTTP serving, and capability management. Phase 34-36 builds this foundation.

## Phase 40 Gap Analysis

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| WAT arithmetic | ✅ Complete | Phase 25 |
| WAT control flow | ✅ Complete | Phase 26 |
| WASM instantiation | ✅ Complete | Phase 27 |
| Hardware governance types | ✅ Complete | Phase 26B |
| Profile enforcement (strict/high_integrity) | ⏳ Phase 28 | KB written, not enforced |
| logicn-core-economics package | ⏳ Phase 29 | KB written, not implemented |
| Integer fast-path interpreter | ⏳ Phase 31 | 5-20× speedup potential |
| Stage B lexer parity | ⏳ Phase 32 | Parallel track |
| verifyPassword WASM HTTP service | ⏳ Phase 34 | First real governed endpoint |
| GovernanceSignature (ML-DSA) | ⏳ Phase 39 | KB written, not implemented |
| Photonic/Tri target stub | ⏳ Phase 40 | Architecture complete, silicon not deployed |

## Recommended Next Phase: 28

The most impactful next step is **Phase 28 — Profile Enforcement**. This is when:
- `profile strict` and `profile high_integrity` become compiler errors (not just KB)
- `LLN-PROFILE-001..007` diagnostics fire for prohibited constructs
- Aerospace examples running under strict profile produce real compiler enforcement
- The profile benchmark shows what the strict profile costs

This completes the "Governance is not optional" promise — not just for effects and capabilities, but for runtime profiles and language restrictions.
