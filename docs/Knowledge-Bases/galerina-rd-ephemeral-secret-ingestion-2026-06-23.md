# Ephemeral Secret Ingestion — Use/Don't-Use Ledger

VERDICT: the core intuition is CONFIRMED — secrets live in governed memory, never on disk, confined by SealTaint, zeroized on exit, fetched fail-closed — and that idea is ~75% already shipped. The framing carries three false/overclaimed pillars (disk-wipe efficacy, RAM impenetrability, blanket no-read rotation) that must be cut/narrowed. Not new science → defensive-pub at most. Overlaps the same-day galerina-rd-53-...-blackhole-protocol doc, which reached the same conclusions.

## Critical verdict up front (4 pillars)
- (1) "cryptographic disk-wipe of exact sectors" — core sound, framing REFUTED (shred ineffective on SSD wear-leveling/over-provisioning per NIST SP 800-88r1, and journaled/COW/snapshot FS per GNU shred CAUTION). Honest inverse = never-write-to-disk, ALREADY the shipped design. Do NOT build a disk shredder (0 such primitives in tree).
- (2) "physically ceases to exist / impenetrable" — OVERCLAIMED (cold-boot DRAM remanence Halderman 2008, swap, core dumps, /proc, hypervisor). Code is already honest: wat-emitter scopes wipe to "host-readable remanence window".
- (3) "stream current secret to operator terminal to edit" — SECURITY REGRESSION, correctly ABSENT. Rotation stays write-only. Narrowed rule: forbid human read-back, not machine validation reads (AWS reads AWSPENDING to test).
- (4) "Cold Boot Paradox" — SOUND but no self-contained answer; needs external anchor (SPIFFE/SPIRE, TPM2, cloud instance-identity+IAM, Vault response-wrapping). Galerina governs the fetch fail-closed, cannot conjure secret-zero; its trust-anchor/revocation anchor the SIGNING identity, not secret-zero.

## Claim-by-claim verdict table (with citations)
SealTaint confinement = ALREADY-SHIPPED (ZT 10), value-state-checker.ts FUNGI-SECRET-001/-002/-003, derivesFromSecret :402-446, redact()/seal() sole declassifiers :507, FileSystem.write sink :164. Never-write-to-disk = ALREADY-SHIPPED (ENV_SECRETS.md, secret-report.json valuesIncluded:false). Disk-shred = REFUTED (GNU shred CAUTION, NIST SP 800-88r1). Arena zeroize-on-exit = ALREADY-SHIPPED honestly scoped (wat-emitter.ts B2/B2b :532/:556/:571-602, "host-readable remanence window" :531/:559/:596/:610). RAM impenetrability = OVERCLAIMED (Halderman USENIX 2008). Rotation engine = ALREADY-SHIPPED ext fail-closed (rotation-manager.ts :60-99/:151-179). Operator read-back = REGRESSION/ABSENT (VaultClient readSecret only). "forbid all read-after-write" = OVERCLAIMED (AWS rotation testSecret reads AWSPENDING). Cold-boot external anchor = SOUND (SPIFFE/Vault). #110 body→manifest obligation = NET-NEW in-bounds. Intrusion-triggered wipe / epoch attestation / mesh cascade = NET-NEW substrate-gated #102-106. Quantum-evaporation/QBER/single-cycle/"all energy" = REFUTE/STRIP. Overall core idea = SOUND, ZT 8.

## Honest buildable design
1. Never-write ingestion (stdin/no-echo · tmpfs/ramfs handle · KMS/Vault fetch) + net-new FUNGI-SECRET-DISK-00x making SecureString→FileSystem.write an unconditional DENY; dev .env dev-only + loud warning. NOT BUILT: any write-then-wipe primitive.
2. Governed in-memory store: SealTaint addressing (shipped) + zeroize-on-exit (shipped, honestly scoped; ADD mlock/MADV_DONTDUMP/RLIMIT_CORE=0/PR_SET_DUMPABLE, residual cold-boot stated-not-solved) + rogue-read→K3 −1 fail-closed (compile-time shipped; live form gated #102-106). NOT BUILT: reveal/getSecret-to-stdout.
3. Write-only fail-closed rotation CLI `galerina secrets set --key NAME` over governed channel; FSM HOLD(K3-0)→quiesce 50ms→atomic swap→zero-wipe, fail-closed by construction; strictly write-only (machine validation read OK, human read-back forbidden); net-new #110 manifest-obligation binding (engine stays ext).
4. Cold-boot via external anchor: K3-gate the fetch (revocation-unknown→DENY, reuses shipped revocation-registry.mjs + trust-anchor.json) + SealTaint the result; anchor is an external dependency Galerina governs but cannot supply.

## Already-shipped vs net-new
SHIPPED (cite): SealTaint, never-write-to-disk, arena secret-zero, ext fail-closed rotation, external trust-anchor+revocation (for signing identity).
NET-NEW in-bounds NOW (core): #110 body→obligation (S, highest value); FUNGI-SECRET-DISK-00x (S); secrets set CLI (M); dev-.env startup warning (S); rogue-read→−1 formalize (S); wire missing kernel .env→governed-memory loader (M, currently a gap — 0 dotenv/process.env hits in app-kernel src).
NET-NEW external dep: cold-boot attestation client (L).
SUBSTRATE-GATED #102-106: intrusion-triggered wipe, epoch attestation, mesh crypto-shred cascade (forgeable cascade = DoS amplifier).
MUST NOT BUILD: disk shredder; impenetrability framing; operator read-back; quantum-evaporation/QBER/single-cycle.

## Zero-trust score + paper verdict
Zero-trust score for the buildable design: 8/10 (SealTaint confinement 10; never-write + zeroize + disk-refusal 9; rotation/#110/anchor-fetch 8). Paper-worthiness: defensive-pub at most — no patent, no flagship paper, no new science.
