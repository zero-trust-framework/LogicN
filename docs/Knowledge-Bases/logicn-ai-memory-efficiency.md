# LogicN — AI & Machine Learning Memory Efficiency

## Status

```
Future Architecture Proposal
Relevant for: Phase 13B (GPU/NPU bridges), Phase 21+ (advanced compute targets)
NLnet proposal viability: HIGH — focuses on planning, governance, memory reuse
Foundation: Passive Execution Plans + Governed Memory Boundaries + Hardware as Capabilities
```

## TL;DR

- LogicN manages AI memory **proactively** (compiler plans it) not reactively (runtime discovers it)
- Typed tensors (`Tensor<Float32, [Batch, 768]>`) give the compiler static memory planning information
- Ephemeral tensor arenas + activation lifetime planning enable early memory reclamation
- Governed quantisation (precision contracts: prefer Int8, allow Float16) makes format choice auditable
- Shared read-only model weights allow multiple agents to share the same memory safely
- AI memory behaviour becomes part of the runtime report and audit proof chain

## The Memory Wall Problem

Modern AI systems are often limited by memory, not compute:

```text
Tensor duplication
Garbage collection pressure
Activation cache growth
GPU memory exhaustion
CPU ↔ GPU transfer costs
Repeated model loading
```

Traditional question: "What memory do we need right now?"
LogicN question: "What memory will we need? Who owns it? When can it be released?"

## Typed Tensor Awareness

```logicn
pure flow classifyEmbeddings(
  embeddings: Tensor<Float32, [Batch, 768]>
) -> ClassificationResult

contract {
  intent { "Classify text embeddings for customer support routing." }
  effects { ai.inference }
}
```

The compiler immediately knows: element type, shape, size, alignment requirements, and can plan accordingly.

---

## Ephemeral Tensor Arenas

Instead of GC-driven reclamation:

```logicn
boundary InferenceArena {
  readonly input: Tensor<Float32, [1, 768]>
}
```

Execution Plan:
```yaml
arena: inference
lifetime: single_inference
release_on_completion: true
```

The entire arena releases when inference finishes — O(1) reclamation, no heap fragmentation.

---

## Activation Lifetime Planning

```logicn
let embedding = Encoder.encode(text)?
let result = Classifier.classify(embedding)?
// embedding can be released here — no future dependency
```

Passive Execution Plan:
```yaml
steps:
  - encode_text
  - classify_embedding
release:
  embedding  # ← released after classify completes, not waiting for GC
```

---

## Governed Quantisation

Precision is a governed contract choice, not a manual deployment decision:

```logicn
contract {
  model {
    uses TicketClassifier
  }

  precision {
    prefer Int8
    allow Float16
    fallback Float32
  }
}
```

Runtime selects the best supported format. Execution plan records what was chosen:
```yaml
model: TicketClassifier
precision: int8
memory_reduction_vs_float32: 75%
```

---

## Shared Read-Only Model Weights

Multi-agent systems can share weights safely because LogicN tracks ownership:

```logicn
contract {
  model {
    uses SharedLanguageModel
  }
}
```

Runtime Plan:
```yaml
weights:
  shared: true
access: readonly
agents: [agentA, agentB, agentC]
```

Safe because LogicN enforces: no agent may mutate shared weights (readonly boundary).

---

## KV Cache Governance

```logicn
contract {
  limits {
    max context tokens 16000
  }
}
```

Runtime may compress, summarise, evict, or archive older context according to policy.

---

## AI Memory Contracts

```logicn
contract {
  limits {
    max memory 512 MB
    max batch size 64
    max prompt size 10000 characters
  }

  precision {
    prefer Int8
    allow Float16
  }

  model {
    uses TicketClassifier
    constraints {
      local_only
      deny training
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Runtime Memory Report

```yaml
runtime_report:
  model: TicketClassifier
  peak_memory: 412 MB
  precision: int8
  shared_weights: true
  tensor_copies: 2
  released_activations: 184
  arena_releases: 1
```

---

## Audit Proof Integration

```yaml
execution_proof:
  model: TicketClassifier
  memory_strategy: shared
  precision: int8
  activation_lifetime_planned: true
  execution_hash: sha256:...
  signature: Ed25519:...
```

Memory behaviour becomes verifiable evidence, not just log output.

## Relationship to Existing LogicN Concepts

| Concept | Role in AI memory |
|---|---|
| Passive Execution Plans | Describe memory lifecycle (arena creation/release) |
| Governed Memory Boundaries | Enforce ownership of tensor regions |
| Hardware as Capabilities | Route tensor workloads to best target |
| Metadata Erasure | Remove memory planning info from executable (not needed at runtime) |
| Runtime Reports | Record peak_memory, precision chosen, tensor_copies |
| Audit Proofs | Verify memory behaviour matched governance contract |

---

## Final Principle

```
Intent
  ↓
Typed Tensors (Tensor<Float32, Shape>)
  ↓
Memory Boundaries (ownership, lifetime)
  ↓
Passive Execution Plan (arena, activation release)
  ↓
Coordinated Compute (NPU/GPU/APU selection)
  ↓
Runtime Report (peak_memory, precision, copies)
  ↓
Audit Proof (verifiable memory behaviour)
```

Traditional AI: manage memory reactively.
LogicN AI: plan memory proactively.

## NLnet Relevance

This proposal is realistic for an NLnet/NGI funding application because it focuses on:
- Governance and auditability of AI workloads (aligns with NGI values)
- Privacy-preserving AI execution (no data leakage across agent boundaries)
- Open standards for AI memory contracts (no vendor lock-in)
- Reproducible, deterministic AI execution (signed audit proof)

Not claimed: LogicN outperforms CUDA, PyTorch, or hardware runtimes.
Claimed: LogicN makes AI execution **explainable, governed, and auditable** across diverse hardware.
