# LogicN Terminology and Naming Philosophy

## Purpose

As LogicN evolves into a governed compute orchestration platform, terminology
across runtime systems, compiler systems, governance systems, AI systems,
hardware systems, documentation, APIs and IR structures must remain stable,
understandable, future-proof, AI-readable and operationally meaningful.

## Core Principle

```text
Names must describe responsibility,
not implementation detail.
```

## Why Naming Matters

Most software projects evolve terminology reactively. This causes:

```text
inconsistent naming
overlapping concepts
ambiguous architecture
AI confusion
documentation drift
unstable APIs
breaking conceptual models
```

LogicN uses intentional terminology architecture from the beginning.

## Naming Priority Table

| Priority | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Operational clarity |
| 2 | AI readability |
| 3 | Future-proof meaning |
| 4 | Stable conceptual mapping |
| 5 | Human understandability |
| 6 | Implementation independence |
| 7 | Minimal ambiguity |

## Naming Rules

### 1. Prefer Responsibility-Based Names

Good:

```text
Authority Control
Runtime Logistics
Execution Coordination
Result Assembly
```

Bad:

```text
ThreadManager
TaskRunner
ServiceHandler
UtilityProcessor
```

### 2. Avoid Temporary Technology Names

Avoid:

```text
GPUManager
ThreadScheduler
PhotonicController
```

These tie the name to a technology that may change. Responsibilities remain
stable; hardware does not.

Prefer:

```text
Resource Deployment
Execution Coordination
Compute Classification
```

### 3. Avoid Ambiguous Generic Terms

Avoid:

```text
Manager
Helper
Handler
Processor
Service
```

These carry almost no architectural meaning.

Prefer:

```text
Control
Coordination
Deployment
Verification
Classification
Assembly
```

### 4. Avoid Human-Centric Assumptions

Traditional software naming assumes human developer interpretation. LogicN must
also support AI reasoning, automated auditing, automated mapping, machine-readable
architecture and autonomous tooling.

Names must remain:

```text
explicit
stable
descriptive
```

### 5. Avoid Excessive Theme Naming

The runtime may use operational terminology inspiration but must avoid fantasy
naming, vague military ranks, mythology naming or unclear metaphors.

Avoid:

```text
Knight
Guardian
Overseer
Execution Paladin
```

Prefer:

```text
Authority Control
Runtime Logistics
Execution Coordination
```

### 6. Avoid Naming by Current Hardware Model

Do not assume CPU-first architecture. Future compute may include optical systems,
wave systems, tensor fabrics, heterogeneous compute and AI-native accelerators.

Naming must remain compute-neutral.

### 7. Separate Governance From Execution in Naming

Governance systems must clearly differ from execution systems:

| Governance | Execution |
| --- | --- |
| Authority Control | Execution Coordination |
| Policy Verification | Resource Deployment |
| Capability Validation | Result Assembly |

This improves security understanding, AI reasoning and architecture auditing.

### 8. Use Explicit Classification Terminology

LogicN classifies execution nature, hardware suitability, compute density,
conversion economics, governance level and scheduling strategy. Names should
emphasize classification rather than optimisation only.

Example:

```text
Execution Classification Engine
```

instead of:

```text
Hot Path Optimizer
```

### 9. Preserve Long-Term Stability

Major architectural terminology should rarely change.

Stable terminology improves documentation durability, AI indexing, architecture
consistency, contributor onboarding and long-term governance.

### 10. Design for AI Interpretation

LogicN documentation assumes AI systems are first-class readers. Names should
map cleanly to responsibility, avoid overloaded meaning, avoid contextual
guessing and avoid unnecessary abbreviation.

Good:

```text
Execution Coordination Scheduler
```

Less ideal:

```text
ECS
```

## Naming Layers

LogicN separates terminology into three layers:

### Governance Layer

```text
Authority Control
Policy Verification
Capability Validation
Boundary Enforcement
Audit Proof
```

Purpose: govern execution authority.

### Coordination Layer

```text
Runtime Command
Execution Coordination
Runtime Logistics
Resource Deployment
```

Purpose: coordinate governed compute.

### Execution Layer

```text
Compute Execution
Tensor Pipelines
Signal Processing
Optical Compute
Result Assembly
```

Purpose: perform approved execution.

## Critical Thinking Rules for Naming

When introducing a new runtime term, ask:

1. Does this describe responsibility?
2. Is the name implementation-independent?
3. Will this still make sense in 10 years?
4. Can AI infer the role from the name?
5. Does the name imply hidden behaviour?

## What LogicN Has Become

Originally LogicN sounded like a logic-oriented language.

The architecture now more accurately resembles:

```text
a governed compute orchestration platform
```

The strongest conceptual description:

```text
A governed operational fabric for heterogeneous compute.
```

This captures governance, orchestration, heterogeneous hardware, execution
planning, runtime coordination and AI-native compute together.

## Final Philosophy

```text
Traditional software names often describe code structures.

LogicN terminology should describe
governed operational responsibility.
```

```text
Name systems by what responsibility they own,
not by how they are temporarily implemented.
```
