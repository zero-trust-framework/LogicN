# LogicN — Borrow, Move and Pinned Memory Semantics

## Overview

Heterogeneous compute introduces multiple memory domains:

```text
CPU memory          GPU VRAM
shared memory       edge device memory
distributed memory  WASM linear memory
```

Data movement between these domains is expensive and error-prone. LogicN requires
explicit ownership and memory-transfer semantics to make GPU planning safe, enable
zero-copy execution, and support deterministic scheduling.

Without borrow/move/pinned semantics, the memory model exists only as design documentation.
The parser and compiler must enforce it.

## Three Ownership Primitives

### Borrow

Temporary access without ownership transfer:

```logicn
borrow tensor -> gpu_kernel()
borrow mut tensor -> transform()
```

Properties:
```text
no ownership transfer
read-only or scoped mutable access
avoids unnecessary copies
compiler-enforced lifetime safety
```

### Move

Explicit ownership transfer — source becomes invalid:

```logicn
move tensor -> gpu_memory
```

Properties:
```text
source is no longer accessible after move
enables deterministic resource ownership
avoids double-frees
improves runtime planning
```

### Pinned Memory

Memory regions locked for high-performance DMA transfer:

```logicn
pinned Tensor<Float16, [1024, 1024]>
pinned buffer<Float16>(1024)
```

Properties:
```text
optimized DMA transfer
reduced transfer latency
zero-copy interoperability
accelerator-friendly allocation
```

## Ownership States

Every value has an explicit ownership state tracked by the compiler:

| State | Description |
|---|---|
| `owned` | Normal owned value on its own lifetime |
| `borrowed` | Temporary access; original owner retains ownership |
| `borrowed mut` | Exclusive mutable access for a scope |
| `moved` | Ownership transferred; source invalid |
| `pinned` | Locked in memory for device transfer |
| `shared` | Explicitly shared runtime-managed value |

---

## Zero-Copy Execution

```logicn
borrow pinned tensor -> inference_engine
```

Zero-copy allows compute targets to operate directly on shared/pinned memory:

```text
no allocation copy
accelerator reads from pinned CPU memory
or both operate on shared device memory
```

---

## Compiler Enforcement

### Track Ownership Through Control Flow

```logicn
move tensor -> gpu

tensor.read()     // COMPILE ERROR: tensor was moved
```

```text
ERROR: LLN-OWN-001: moved value used after move
  `tensor` moved here: move tensor -> gpu
  `tensor` used again here: tensor.read()
```

### Prevent Borrow/Move Conflicts

```logicn
let ref = borrow tensor
move tensor -> gpu   // COMPILE ERROR: cannot move while borrowed
```

### Validate Lifetimes

```logicn
let result = {
  borrow tensor -> inference()
  // borrow expires at end of block
}
// tensor is owned again here
```

---

## Placement-Aware Ownership

Ownership interacts with compute placement:

```logicn
move tensor -> placement gpu   // owned by GPU
```

Transfer policies:

```logicn
transfer async tensor -> gpu
transfer zero_copy tensor -> inference_engine
```

---

## AST Node Vocabulary (committed in Phase 3)

The following node kinds are added to `AstNodeKind` in `logicn-core/src/index.ts`.
Phase 4 parses into this vocabulary; Phase 5 uses it for lifetime analysis.

| AstNodeKind | Syntax form | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `borrowExpr` | `borrow x` | Immutable temporary access; no ownership transfer |
| `borrowMutExpr` | `borrow mut x` | Exclusive mutable access within a scope |
| `moveExpr` | `move x` | Explicit ownership transfer; source invalidated |
| `pinnedDecl` | `pinned x` | Memory locked for DMA / accelerator transfer |
| `ownershipTransfer` | `x -> y` | Ownership transfer to a named target |
| `configMemoryBlock` | `memory { ... }` (manifest) | Project/runtime memory config (boot.lln) |
| `borrowScopeBlock` | `memory { ... }` (code) | Code-level ownership/borrow scope block |

> **Phase boundary:** `borrowExpr`, `borrowMutExpr`, `moveExpr`, `pinnedDecl`,
> and `ownershipTransfer` are declared in Phase 3 to give the parser its target
> vocabulary. Parser production rules for these nodes are implemented in Phase 4.
> Full lifetime/borrow analysis is implemented in Phase 5.

## Compiler Analysis Passes

```text
lifetime analysis        — determine live ranges for each owned value
ownership propagation    — track ownership state through all control paths
move validation          — ensure moved values are not used afterward
borrow checking          — ensure borrows do not outlive owners
pinned memory planning   — identify pinnable allocations
transfer optimization    — minimize copies; batch transfers; colocate compute
```

## Multi-Target Ownership

| Target | Requirement |
|---|---|
| GPU | Pinned buffers, transfer scheduling, ownership tracking |
| WASM | Explicit linear memory safety, transfer-aware compilation |
| Edge devices | Constrained memory planning, deterministic allocation |
| Distributed | Explicit ownership boundaries, transfer-safe serialization |

---

## Future Extensions

```logicn
// Shared memory regions
shared tensor

// Placement-aware move
move tensor -> placement gpu

// Async transfer
transfer async tensor -> gpu_memory

// Remote borrow across nodes
remote borrow tensor from node "worker-2"
```

## Diagnostics

The canonical memory-checker diagnostic series is `LLN-MEMORY-*`, defined in
`logicn-core-compiler/src/index.ts`. The former `LLN-OWN-*` codes are retired;
the mapping below shows their equivalents.

| Code | Name | Meaning | Former alias |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LLN-MEMORY-001` | `USE_AFTER_MOVE` | Moved value used after ownership transferred | `LLN-OWN-001` |
| `LLN-MEMORY-002` | `BORROW_AFTER_MOVE` | Cannot borrow a value after ownership has moved | `LLN-OWN-002` |
| `LLN-MEMORY-003` | `BORROW_ESCAPES_SCOPE` | Borrowed reference cannot outlive its owner | `LLN-OWN-003` |
| `LLN-MEMORY-004` | `READONLY_MUTATION` | Cannot mutate a value through a readonly reference | — |
| `LLN-MEMORY-005` | `MUTABLE_ALIAS` | A mutable borrow cannot coexist with another active borrow | — |
| `LLN-MEMORY-006` | `BOUNDS_VIOLATION` | Index may be outside collection bounds | — |
| `LLN-MEMORY-007` | `UNCHECKED_ACCESS_OUTSIDE_UNSAFE` | Unchecked access must be inside an approved unsafe block | `LLN-OWN-004` |
| `LLN-MEMORY-008` | `UNSAFE_MEMORY_REQUIRES_FALLBACK` | Unsafe memory operation must declare a safe fallback | — |

> **Note:** `LLN-OWN-005` (shared value synchronization) and `LLN-OWN-006`
> (transfer requires ownership) are post-v1 diagnostics covering `shared` and
> `transfer` keywords. They will be added to the `LLN-MEMORY-*` series when
> those keywords are activated.
