# Galerina — AI Canonical Index

## How to use this file

When generating Galerina code or answering questions about Galerina, consult the
CANONICAL docs listed here first. Do not use LEGACY or DEPRECATED docs as the
source of truth — they may contain superseded rules or pre-v1 patterns.

The machine-readable alias map is `galerina-glossary.schema.yaml`. Load it for
term and alias resolution without prose parsing.

The pipeline spec is `galerina-spec-manifest.yaml`. Load it for canonical file
paths used in prompt bootstrapping and tooling.

## Legacy Docs (historical reference only)

These docs contain pre-v1 designs. Do NOT use them as the primary source of truth
for code generation. They are retained for historical context.

| Doc | Why legacy | Superseded by |
|---|---|---|
| `galerina-core-effect-checker-v02.md` | v0.2 effect checker internals; `CheckedFunction` applied to `fn` which cannot declare effects in v1 | `effect-checker-and-boundary-checker.md`, `flow-vs-fn-security-model.md` |
| `galerina-core-security-v02.md` | v0.2 security model | `galerina-security-model-layers.md` |
| `galerina-core-manifest-generation-v02.md` | v0.2 manifest generation | `galerina-package-manifest-spec.md` |
| `galerina-core-cli-v02.md` | v0.2 CLI | `build-system-and-cli.md` |
| `galerina-core-compute-v02.md` | v0.2 compute model | `galerina-compute-target-optimisation.md` |
| `galerina-core-config-v02.md` | v0.2 config | `galerina-core-config-dotenv-trust-model.md` |
| `galerina-core-logic-v02.md` | v0.2 logic model | `galerina-core-logic-omni-logic.md` |
| `galerina-core-network-v02.md` | v0.2 network | `galerina-core-network-governance.md` |
| `galerina-core-photonic-v02.md` | v0.2 photonic | `galerina-core-photonic-backend-architecture.md` |
| `galerina-core-reports-v02.md` | v0.2 reports | `observability-and-monitoring.md` |
| `galerina-framework-api-server-v02.md` | v0.2 API server | `galerina-framework-api-server-implementation.md` |
| `phase-4-parser-ast-plan.md` | Phase 4 planning doc — AST design intent | `ast-value-encoding.md`, `galerina-ast-published-schema.md` |

## Do Not Use For Generation

| Doc | Reason |
|---|---|
| `galerina-core-effect-checker-v02.md` | SUPERSEDED; contains incorrect `fn`-with-effects pattern |
| Any `*-v02.md` file | v0.2 historical; all superseded by current phase docs |
| `galerina-roadmap-*.md` (multiple) | Planning/roadmap docs — not language specs |
| `galerina-phase-9-roadmap.md`, `galerina-phase-10-roadmap.md` | Roadmap items — not finalized specs |
| `bootstrap-runtime-roadmap.md`, `node-hosted-runtime-roadmap.md` | Implementation roadmaps, not specs |
| `galerina-runtime-in-galerina-roadmap.md` | Roadmap only |

## Quick Alias Resolution

If you see a term and are unsure of the canonical Galerina name, consult:
1. `galerina-glossary.schema.yaml` (machine-readable, preferred for tooling)
2. `galerina-glossary.md` (human-readable, includes examples and See Also links)

Key disambiguation rules:
- `fn` ≠ `flow` ≠ `route` — three distinct constructs with different authority levels
- `fn` cannot declare effects — only `flow` variants can
- `Tri` ≠ `Bool` ≠ `Decision` — three distinct types
- `Auto` ≠ `Any` — `Auto` is compile-time inference; `Any` does not exist in Galerina v1
- `unsafe let` = boundary input marking; `safe mut` = gate upgrade — not mutation modifiers
- `->` and `:` are both valid return-type separators; `:` is the modern preferred form
- `else if` is a **hard error** (SPORE-SYNTAX-010) — use `match` or sequential `if`
- `when expr => body` is a guard arm in `match`; `200 => body` is an integer literal arm
- `effects {}` is optional for `pure flow` — omission means no effects (pure)
- `with effects [...]` is a **hard error** (SPORE-SYNTAX-LEGACY-001) — use `contract { effects {} }`
- Phase 55 ML-DSA: `spore.gov.sig.v2` = dual-signature artifact (ed25519 + ml-dsa-65); `generateHybridGovernanceKeyPair` produces the key pair; SPORE-HW-101..104 are the post-quantum attestation diagnostics
