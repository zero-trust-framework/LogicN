# R&D — TritMesh notes 1-5 + 52-3D (for Galerina) (2026-06-23)

> **R&D numbers (assigned 2026-06-24):** **0106** = TritMesh notes 1-6 survey (substrate router + MeshQL/.tmf ecosystem) · **0107** = 52-3D-1/2 photonic/ternary survey + combination · **0108** = cross-synthesis + the 3 net-new Galerina mechanics. Prior run = workflow `we2yovu53`.
>
> **RE-VALIDATION 2026-06-24 (against current code, before formalizing):** of the 3 net-new mechanics below, **#1 (degrade-only telemetry → K3 admission feedback loop) is now SHIPPED** — `galerina-core-network/src/admission-feedback.ts` implements `telemetryToSideSignal` / `withTelemetryFeedback` / `certGateWithTelemetry` (degrade-only `≤+1`, folds via `vAnd`/No-Coercion `min(t*,r)≤t*`, fail-closed: empty reading = `+1` no-op, garbage reading = `0` throttle; it cites this R&D as "net-new mechanic #1"). Its LIVE wiring into the api-server cert path is OPT-IN (the host injects telemetry), same default-off pattern as the cert-gate resolver. **#2 (K3 `Result.Masked` partial-return) and #3 (Governed Transformation-Matrix admission, T-as-signed-artifact) remain NET-NEW (0 hits in current source) and buildable** — #3's governance rail is core-buildable now; its photonic side is #102-106-gated.

## Bottom line

Across 7 per-note surveys and 2 combination passes (tritmesh-1..6, 52-3D-1/2), **~85-90% of every head RE-DERIVES already-shipped Galerina substrate/governance work**, exactly as VERIFY-BEFORE-BUILD predicted. The notes are a single chained TritMesh brainstorm: a substrate-routing gateway ("Tri-Pipe Substrate Router" = R&D-007 / note 6), a MeshQL/.tmf product ecosystem (notes 1-5), and a photonic/ternary physics tutorial (52-3D-1/2).

After deduping, **three genuinely net-new Galerina governance mechanics** survive scrutiny, all small, all invariant-safe, all TRACK-or-build-on-shipped-rails:

1. **Degrade-only telemetry → K3 admission feedback loop** (tritmesh-4 §3) — the strongest. Both halves ship; the closed runtime loop does not.
2. **Governed Transformation-Matrix admission (T-as-signed-artifact)** — EMERGENT only when 52-3D-1 ("geometry = code") composes with 52-3D-2 (".tmf governs the reprogram blob"). Freivalds verifies the *result*; nothing admits T-the-matrix as signed code.
3. **K3 ternary partial-return / per-branch `Result.Masked` response shaping** (trittmesh-5) — masking is binary-only today (redact/seal/reject); no three-valued keep-the-rest response shaper.

Everything else is ALREADY-SHIPPED (cite below), REFUTED physics (O(1) matmul, Grover line-rate, superdense "drop the MAC"), or TRITMESH-ONLY product surface (MeshQL, .tmf passport, 5-product suite, Any-Sync mesh). **All invariants hold:** crypto stays Binary, photonic is degrade-only with projected-not-measured perf, no crypto-on-photonic, K3-0 is fail-safe-only.

## The Tri-Pipe-Router vs Galerina-Tri-Pipe distinction (read this first)

The task name conflates two same-named things:

- **The notes' "Tri-Pipe Substrate Router"** (R&D-007 / tritmesh-6) is a *physics-aware routing GATEWAY* across Binary-silicon (S_B) / Hybrid-accelerator (S_H) / Photonic-quantum (S_P).
- **Galerina's shipped "Tri-Pipe"** is `galerina-tri-pipe/src/execution-router.ts` (`ExecutionRouter.route` + `createTriPipeEngine`) — a 3-axis composition (AXIS-1 capability tier via `resolveHardware`, AXIS-2 `routePrecision`, AXIS-3 `PartitionDecider` net-win gate).

These are **the same thing**: the notes' R(o) re-derives `ExecutionRouter.route` 1:1. Every router mechanic in the notes is shipped — routing function, `R(D_crypto)→S_B` (= FUNGI-SUBSTRATE-001, `partition-decider.ts:112`), `E_route = min(cap,avail)` (= `vAnd`/`allOf`), the analog→trit discretization gate (= `decideAtBoundary` + `effectiveVerdict=vAnd` + `freivalds.ts` tolerance re-verify + `photonic-bridge.ts:99` 0b11 corrupt-trit trap), and the Tower-Citizen sim/hw hot-swap (= `photonic-switch.ts selectPhotonicBackend`, fail-closed, attested-only). **Nothing in the router itself is a new mechanic.**

## NEW mechanics worth implementing in Galerina (ranked)

1. **Degrade-only telemetry → K3 admission feedback loop** (governance/runtime, S). The two halves ship — blind observability (`galerina-observability createObservability`, counts/error-rates/health, no payloads) and the degrade-only side-signal (`cert-gate.ts withSideSignal`, `vAnd`, No-Coercion `min(t*,r)≤t*`). NOT shipped: feeding the *live* anomaly metric back into the admission/cert gate as that operand, so a node auto-degrades ALLOW→INDETERMINATE under attack. Net-new runtime self-throttle, reuses `withSideSignal`+`vAnd`, no new crypto/lattice.

2. **K3 ternary partial-return / per-branch `Result.Masked` response shaping** (governance/runtime, M). Today masking is binary-only: `governance-verifier.ts` rejects a leak (redact/seal/remove-field) and `view(cap1|cap2)` is a masked pointer; there is no three-valued per-branch partial-return that denies one field while returning the rest with a typed `Masked(code)` sentinel carrying FUNGI-GOV-3VL-001. A thin fail-closed composition of `decideAtBoundary`+`view()`+`redact()` at an output boundary; deny-by-default on unknown branches.

3. **Governed Transformation-Matrix admission (T-as-signed-artifact)** (governance/compiler, M). EMERGENT only when 52-3D-1 (geometry=code) composes with 52-3D-2 (.tmf governs the reprogram blob). Verified absent (0 hits for config-blob/matrix fingerprint/tensor-admission). `hybrid-engine.ts:219` Freivalds verifies the matmul *result*, NOT that T is the admitted matrix — a hot weight/config swap is an unsigned code path today. Extend signed-admission (`fuse-loader`/`wasmHash`/`behavioralFingerprint`) to a photonic-config artifact class + `photonic.reprogram` capability, admitted by `certGate`/`decideAtBoundary` before the PPU port reprograms the mesh. HW-gated (#102-106) but the *governance rail* is core-buildable now.

## REFUTED (with reason)

- **Photonic O(1) matmul / "speed of light" / t=L·n/c** — precompute trade (O(N²) apply, dense O(N²) mem, fusion densifies 39x); `rd-aot-tensor-precompute-proof.mjs`. Conversion tax collapses Meech ideal 9.4x → realized ~1.9x (retention ~0.20, `partition-decider.ts`). Present only as labelled-aspirational.
- **Grover line-rate / quantum DB search** — unbacked line-rate claim; silicon sim is O(2^N) and loses quantum security.
- **ntt_mul ≈ matmul** — refuted; different operation.
- **Measurement-based "third logic" (MBQC) as a new governance primitive** — governance treats it identically to any low-trust analog reading; adds no primitive.
- **Superdense "drop the MAC/AEAD because entanglement self-proves integrity"** — VIOLATES crypto-Binary + No-Coercion; photonic/quantum state is PAC-learnable. Keep digital ML-DSA/AEAD always.
- **Crypto/KDF on photonics "to speed it up"** — forbidden by FUNGI-SUBSTRATE-001 (0.999≠1.0 corrupts keys); vAnd=min cannot lift 0→+1. Compiler already traps it.

## TritMesh-only (saved for later)

- MeshQL / TritMeshQL (query-as-capability-contract; graph as .tmf nodes+edges) — zero hits in core Galerina source; the reusable nucleus (K3 row verdicts, governance DCE) is shipped; the engine is a product.
- .tmf passport / "Govern-Don't-Absorb" / 5-product suite (DB/Object/Stream/Vector/Audit) / Dumb-App-Smart-Core gateway — consumes shipped .tmf+K3+capability machinery; adds no governance algebra; Smart-Core isolation is aspirational #102-106.
- Any-Sync P2P mesh resurrection / CID-pointer rollback / hold-in-0 wasm hot-swap — product data-plane/networking; borrowed K3-0 is shipped.
- Encrypted cold-index OpenSearch + arena zero-wipe — arena-zeroize is owned (R&D 0055 B2); ⚠ cleartext-semantic-embedding search collides with FUNGI-PRIVACY-002 if ever pulled in.
- Sync/async photonic timing, neuromorphic LIF neuron, Base-3 optical adder, holographic storage — substrate/hardware vocabulary; governed as ordinary low-trust Citizens behind the discretization gate.
- Nested-record SoA auto-flatten — TritMeshQL-only; single-level reject is the fail-closed default if ever built.
