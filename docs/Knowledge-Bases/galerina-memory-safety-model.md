## 0. "As safe as Rust, safer on three axes" (the positioning — added 2026-06-26, #65)

Galerina reaches Rust's memory-safety **outcome without a borrow checker**, and adds guarantees Rust does not. Honestly scoped:

- **As safe — memory-safe by construction.** The default value runtime needs no borrow checker: value semantics (no shared mutable aliasing — a mutated copy never affects its source), no references, no raw pointers, no pointer arithmetic, no manual malloc/free. Stage-A is a GC tree-walker; the production path is WASM with a monotonic per-flow bump heap + capability-sandboxed, bounds-checked linear memory. The C-class bugs a borrow checker exists to prevent — use-after-free, double-free, buffer overflow, dangling pointers, data races — **cannot occur on these paths by construction**. (The one OPTIONAL manual-reuse surface, the deterministic aerospace `StaticMemoryPool`, is made temporally safe by per-allocation **generation tags** that trap a stale handle fail-closed — `LSM-UAF-001` — so UAF can't occur there either; see AMENDMENT 1.)
- **Safer #1 — no `unsafe{}` that silently drops guarantees.** Rust's `unsafe{}` disables the borrow checker with no required justification. Galerina has no such hatch: its `unsafe block` is GOVERNED — it REQUIRES a declared reason + a safe fallback flow (`FUNGI-MEMORY-008`), raw-pointer use outside it is a PRODUCTION_BLOCKER (`FUNGI-RAWPTR-001`), and — decisively — the production WASM emitter has **no raw-pointer / dereference lowering at all**, so there is no raw-memory path to escape into. Safety cannot be silently turned off.
- **Safer #2 — defense-in-depth: runtime containment of a compiler bug.** Even a miscompilation executes inside capability-bounded, bounds-checked WASM linear memory — a sandbox that contains it. Rust has no runtime containment of its own codegen bugs.
- **Safer #3 — information-flow safety on top of memory safety.** Capabilities + effects + taint (SealTaint; `FUNGI-SECRET-001..004`; `FUNGI-PRIVACY-002`) prevent data-leak / confused-deputy classes Rust does not address at the language level. "Safer than Rust" = memory-safe **and** governance-safe.

**The one honest caveat.** This rests on value semantics. If Galerina ever adds **shared mutable references**, the borrow-checker bug classes return and a borrow checker (or equivalent) would then be needed — revisit `FUNGI-MEMORY-001..005` at that point. Until then they are correctly RESERVED / NOT-EMITTED (honest-retired in #65; the reserved set is **001..007**, since 004/005/006 are also un-emitted, not just 001/002/003/007).

**Not claimed (refused overclaims — RD-0130):** no CHERI "0-cycle bounds" (CHERI is not a Galerina compile target), no photonic "particle-level immutability", no WDM "zero-alloc memory". The safety here is the value-semantics + sandbox story above — measured and bounded, nothing hardware-magical.

## 1. The model (honest core)
Galerina's memory safety is **NOT a Rust borrow checker.** It is a **"Governed Capability + Ternary-Tagged Memory"** model:
- **(a) Substrate:** a GC-managed single-threaded TypeScript tree-walker for the live runtime — **no manual free** in the interpreter path; reclamation is the host (V8) tracing GC. Compiles toward WASM (a per-flow bump heap + a separately-managed fixed `StaticMemoryPool` arena).
- **(b) The enforced spine (already shipped):** the **value-state / taint** pass (`value-state-checker.ts`: Unsafe/Safe/Validated/Tainted/Protected/Redacted/Secret/ReadOnly; fail-closed deny-by-default origins; discharge only via `validate`/`sanitize`/`redact`/`seal`) + the **effect / capability** passes + the **K3 collapse** at the trust boundary. This proves what a borrow checker would, via dataflow over *trust/provenance* rather than aliasing/lifetimes.
- **(c) The ternary substrate primitives:** the `0b11` illegal-trit **corruption trap**, guard-page canaries, **REJECT-fill-on-erase** (zeroed/erased ⇒ REJECT(−1) ⇒ fail-closed), and `consensusTrit`.
- **(d) Kept from Rust (no borrow checker):** immutable-by-default, `Option<T>` over null, and **consume-once linearity for linear resources** — but the latter ships as **`FUNGI-AFFINE-001`** (affine typestate in `value-state-checker.ts`: a single-use passport/credential consumed twice → denied), **NOT** via the unbuilt `FUNGI-MEMORY-001 USE_AFTER_MOVE`. **Dropped:** the full lifetime/borrow checker. `FUNGI-MEMORY-001..007` were specced for it but are **RESERVED / NOT-EMITTED** (no pass produces them; honest-retired in #65 — value-semantics makes the bug class structurally absent); only `FUNGI-MEMORY-008` (the `unsafe block` reason/fallback scanner) emits. Correction to earlier drafts: the `move`/`borrow`/`pinned` keywords parse and the example files **compile clean** — they are reserved-but-unenforced surface, not "unparseable".

## 2. All-stances survey (every paradigm vs Galerina)
| Paradigm | What it gives | Galerina fit | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tracing GC (+ gen/incremental/concurrent) | reachability reclaim, no manual free | have-equivalent (the tree-walker IS V8 GC) | keep as substrate |
| Naive reference counting | prompt reclaim, no cycles | inapplicable (pure overhead on GC'd; Vale measured RC +25%) | decline |
| **Perceus precise RC (Koka)** | compile-time precise drop-at-last-use, garbage-free, no pause | converges (the value-cousin of move-linearity + tombstone) | **track** — deterministic drop-insertion for *escaping* objects; "regions first, precise-RC for escapes, never tracing in production" |
| Linear/affine (Austral, ATS) | use-once; no UAF/double-free, no lifetimes | have-equivalent (move/`USE_AFTER_MOVE` = affine) | keep; gap = enforce *must-use* (linear) on secret/capability handles |
| **Region-based (Cyclone/MLKit/Verona)** | bulk O(1) free at region end | **already-have** (per-flow bump heap + `StaticMemoryPool` + `lockFlight`) | don't re-add; don't add Rust lifetimes |
| Rust full borrow checker | compile-time aliasing-XOR-mutation, zero-cost | inapplicable (mismatched to GC tree-walker; pervasive coloring vs the async-tax lesson) | **EXCLUDED** (the 0034 rejection) |
| **Pony ref-caps (iso/val/ref/box/tag/trn)** | per-reference alias/mutability/sendability → data-race freedom | converges (per-ref capability = Galerina's per-ref governed cap+taint shape; iso≈move, val≈immutable-default) | import ONE idea: an **iso-like isolation flag** for secret bindings + the **tag** opaque-handle concept; not the whole lattice |
| Verona regions + concurrent ownership | region = unit of ownership + concurrency | could-adopt (maps onto the Arena + future concurrency) | track (longer-term) |
| **Vale generational references** | per-alloc gen counter checked at deref → UAF trap (~+11%) | converges (= tombstoning generalized) | **ADOPT the gen-tag** (see §3) |
| CHERI (HW capabilities) | unforgeable fat pointers, base+bounds+tag | inapplicable (needs silicon) | inspiration only; software analogue = MSWasm handles |
| ARM MTE / SPARC ADI | HW lock-and-key tags | inapplicable (needs silicon) | emulate the IDEA via gen tags |
| Intel CET (shadow stack/IBT) | HW control-flow integrity | inapplicable (needs silicon; WASM resists ROP already) | out of scope |
| ASan shadow-memory + quarantine | redzones + delayed reuse | could-adopt (a quarantine delay is a cheaper partial mitigation) | prefer gen tags (deterministic, aerospace fit) |
| **MSWasm handles** | segment+offset+bounds+unique-id inside linear memory (the `isCorrupted` field mirrors `0b11`) | **could-adopt** | ADOPT for the WASM intra-module **spatial** gap; the handle id can BE the ternary generation word |
| **WasmGC struct/array refs** | VM-managed typed refs outside linear memory | could-adopt | ADOPT/track — the upstream way to close the intra-module gap for record types |
| Ternary tombstoning (REJECT-fill + `live(i):=getTrit(i)!==-1`) | fail-closed read of a still-free cell, native to the encoding | keep | KEEP for spatial/corruption + still-free reads; **does NOT cover reuse-after-realloc** |
| Separation logic / capability-machine (CHERI+Iris) | one unforgeable-capability invariant, machine-checkable | **missed framing** | track — see §3 unification |

## 3. The honest verdict — **amend-add-paradigm** (spine robust; one real add)
- **AMENDMENT 1 (load-bearing, grounded in shipped code):** ternary tombstoning catches a *still-free* read but **NOT free+reallocate** — after realloc the REJECT poison is overwritten by valid trits, so a stale handle reads plausible data and aliases the new object (ABA/type-confusion). **This is a real shipped surface:** `galerina-core-sentinel-memory/src/static-memory-pool.ts` `free()` (≈:147-157) returns blocks to a per-segment free-list and `allocate()` (≈:97-127) re-hands the same ptr, with **no** generation/tombstone/quarantine; `memory-validator.ts` checks only align+bounds (**no temporal check**) — and the pool targets mission-critical/aerospace. **Fix:** a **per-allocation generation tag** (Vale/MTE/MSWasm-id family) stored in `live` + embedded in the handle; deref checks `handle.gen === currentGen(block)`, mismatch ⇒ `SecurityTrap` (fail-closed). Keep REJECT-fill + `0b11` for the TPL substrate (spatial/corruption). ~~Owner-gated; surfaced for a fix.~~ **RESOLVED (verified 2026-06-26, #65):** the generation tag IS shipped — `static-memory-pool.ts` bumps `Block.generation` per (re)allocation (`genCounter`) and `assertLive()` throws `SecurityTrap("LSM-UAF-001", …)` on a stale handle / generation mismatch (the free+realloc ABA case). The temporal-aliasing gap is closed fail-closed: the pool now **traps** UAF rather than aliasing. So "no manual free" holds for the DEFAULT paths (interpreter GC + WASM bump heap), and the one OPTIONAL manual-reuse surface (this aerospace pool) is temporally safe by the gen-tag trap.
- **AMENDMENT 2 (scoping):** the WAT bump heap has **no free** (monotonic `$__fungi_heap`; records never freed within a flow; host GC reclaims) ⇒ it is **spatially**-gapped (needs MSWasm/WasmGC) but **NOT temporally**-gapped — gen tags would be dead weight there. Keep the two surfaces separate (gen tags ⇒ the free-list pool only).
- **AMENDMENT 3 (keep, don't add):** region/arena lifetimes are already the de-facto model — do **not** add Rust lifetime annotations.
- **The unification framing (high-leverage, ties to note 40 / Z3):** REJECT-poison, the generation id, handle bounds, the effect permission, and the taint bit are all **fields of ONE capability** governed by one fail-closed invariant — *capabilities can only be narrowed, never forged or widened* (CHERI monotonicity ≈ Galerina's taint-monotonicity + domain-guard clamping). Expressing memory+taint+effect as a **single capability-monotonicity invariant** is exactly the kind of property an SMT solver proves cleanly — the highest-leverage unification, tracked as a framing (not a redesign).

## 4. Inapplicable-and-why
CHERI, ARM MTE, SPARC ADI, Intel CET all require **silicon Galerina does not target** (the ternary VPP is a software sim; photonic HW EXCLUDED) — their *ideas* are absorbed in software (gen tags emulate MTE lock/key; MSWasm handles emulate CHERI bounds/provenance). The Rust borrow checker is inapplicable because there is no compile-time aliasing-XOR-mutation regime in a GC tree-walker (and it's pervasive memory-coloring, against the measured async-coloring lesson).
