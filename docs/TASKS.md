- [x] Add Runtime Terminology Evolution Knowledge Base concept covering the
  shift from VM/thread/instruction terminology to governed operational
  coordination terminology
- [x] Add Terminology And Naming Philosophy Knowledge Base concept covering

  Control, Runtime Logistics, Resource Deployment Balancer, Execution
  Coordination Scheduler and Result Assembler
- [x] Add Compute Balancer Knowledge Base concept covering approved hardware
  selection, hardware pressure, device trust, thermal state, queue depth,
  fallback decisions and the rule that the Balancer cannot grant authority

  Resource Deployment Balancer responsibility
- [ ] Decide when explanatory terms such as Governed Execution Director should
  become formal package/API/report names versus architecture documentation
  names

  hardware availability, hardware trust, fallback decisions, thermal pressure
  and queue pressure

  ownership and migration impact

## Phase 19: Data Visibility View Terminology

- [x] Add Data Visibility View Terminology Knowledge Base concept defining
  `view` as the field-level data exposure term

  of `classify`

  `view`
- [x] Document separation between field exposure views and broader security,
  input, AI, threat or compute classification
- [x] Add Built-In View Levels Knowledge Base concept defining `public`,
  `internal`, `private`, `confidential`, `secret`, `restricted` and
  `regulated` as built-in runtime/language view levels under `Runtime.View`
- [x] Define `public` as safe to expose under normal allowed response rules and
  `private` as owned data exposed only when ownership checks pass
- [x] Add Standard View Behaviour Knowledge Base concept defining that common
  view behaviour is declared once and inherited by permission references
- [x] Define that permission-level view conditions should normally narrow
  built-in view behaviour and widening requires explicit policy review/reporting

  syntax
- [ ] Define formal `Runtime.View` grammar/schema and generated
  `view-level-report.json`
- [ ] Define view-behaviour inheritance and override diagnostics, including
  `view-behaviour-report.json` and `view-override-report.json`

  data-classification reports
- [ ] Audit remaining documentation examples and migrate field exposure cases
  while preserving non-exposure uses of classification

## Phase 20: Variable Mutation And Vault Design

- [x] Add Variable Mutation Vault Design Knowledge Base concept covering
  local `let`, explicit `mut`, `readonly`, protected `vault`, `secure` access
  and `Secret<T>`
- [x] Define v0.1 direction that `readonly` replaces `const` unless a distinct
  compile-time constant need appears later
- [x] Define requirements that mutation must be explicit and shared state must
  live in protected vaults
- [x] Add Explicit Mutation And Vault Writes Knowledge Base concept clarifying
  that `mut foo++` and `mut secure.*` writes are preferred while unmarked
  `foo++`, plain assignment mutation and direct source-level
  `SessionVault.write(context, ...)` calls are not the v0.1 surface
- [ ] Update parser/checker status so assignment without `mut` is diagnosed
- [ ] Update parser/checker status so increment and decrement operations
  without `mut` are diagnosed
- [ ] Define `readonly` grammar and diagnostics
- [ ] Define vault declaration grammar, `secure` access checks and generated
  read/write permission contracts
- [ ] Define variable-scope, mutation, readonly-value, vault-access,
  vault-security and secret-flow report schemas

## Phase 21: Preplanned Startup And Fast Response

- [x] Add Preplanned Startup And Fast Response Knowledge Base concept covering
  verified boot profiles, deterministic boot snapshots, phased warmup,
  precompiled app-kernel decisions, safe startup caches, keep-alive transport
  policy and outbound connection pooling
- [x] Update startup and fast response docs with boot snapshot, generation
  commands, known-safe request path and transport-profile wording
- [x] Define requirements that startup cache artefacts are deterministic,
  non-secret, bounded, content-addressed where practical, safe to delete, safe
  to bypass and never required for correctness
- [x] Define requirements that keep-alive, HTTP/2 multiplexing and HTTP/3/QUIC
  remain deployment-profile transport capabilities rather than core language
  syntax
- [ ] Define `galerina.boot-profile.v1` schema for routes, policies, validators,
  effects, package graphs, runtime plan, target plan, cache metadata and report
  references

  route-table, policy-table, validator, package-graph, target-plan and startup
  report artefacts

  schemas for boot readiness, warmup state, inbound transport, outbound pools,
  cache decisions and warnings
- [ ] Define future CLI command contracts for `Galerina startup:plan`,
  `Galerina startup:warm`, `Galerina startup:report` and
  `Galerina serve --use-boot-profile`

## Phase 22: Secure By Default Syntax Principles

- [x] Add Secure By Default Syntax Principles Knowledge Base concept covering
  deny-by-default permissions, explicit authority, input contracts, output view
  rules, ownership checks, safe database syntax, target-aware encoding,
  secret-safe syntax, resource budgets, audit declarations, governed context and
  denied unsafe defaults
- [x] Define requirements that these are syntax/logic principles rather than
  only runtime checks
- [ ] Define formal permission deny-by-default diagnostics and effective
  permission reports
- [ ] Define request/input contract grammar for required fields, string length,
  numeric ranges, allowed values and body-size limits
- [ ] Define response target grammar for `json`, `html`, `log`, `ai_prompt`,
  `shell`, `sql`, `url` and `csv` encoding policy
- [ ] Define typed database query grammar and gated `db.raw_sql` authority
  diagnostics
- [ ] Define field-read permission grammar for explicit allow lists,
  `fields: all except [...]`, `fields: all current except [...]`, `fields: all`
  and related sensitivity/future-field diagnostics
- [ ] Define default and explicit `budget` grammar for CPU, memory, time,
  body-size, loop, recursion, task, network, AI/tool and accelerator limits
- [ ] Define audit declaration grammar and report schemas for security-relevant
  flows

## Phase 23: Audit Actor Model

- [x] Add Audit Actor Model Knowledge Base concept covering automatic runtime
  actor attribution, permission-based audit events, multiple actor roles,
  manual metadata limits and no silent actor spoofing
- [x] Define requirements that audit identity inherits governed runtime context
  and cannot be silently overridden by application code
- [x] Add Multi-Actor Audit Events Knowledge Base concept covering affected,
  delegated, source, system and AI actor metadata while preserving
  runtime-owned primary actor attribution
- [ ] Define audit event schema fields for actor, delegated actor, source actor,
  request ID, route, flow, permission, capabilities, timestamp, execution ID,
  result, trust zone and redaction decisions
- [ ] Define multi-actor audit schema roles for `primary_actor`,
  `affected_actor`, `delegated_actor`, `source_actor`, `system_actor` and
  `ai_actor`, including runtime-approved system actor validation
- [ ] Define diagnostics for attempts to override runtime-owned audit identity
  fields such as primary actor, request ID, permission or execution ID
- [ ] Define report schemas for `audit-actor-report.json`,
  `audit-event-report.json`, `audit-context-report.json` and
  `audit-spoofing-warning-report.json`
