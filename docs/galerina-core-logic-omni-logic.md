# Galerina Core Logic: Omni Logic

Status: Draft v0.1/vNext research and architecture document  
Package: `galerina-core-logic`  
Purpose: Define the Omni Logic concept for future multi-valued reasoning, uncertainty modelling and heterogeneous logic systems within Galerina.

---

# 1. Overview

Galerina is fundamentally:

```text
safe
explicit
deterministic
governance-first
```

The core runtime and compiler should remain binary-safe and deterministic.

However, future systems involving:

```text
AI reasoning
uncertainty modelling
distributed planning
optical systems
probabilistic orchestration
```

may require richer logic models than simple:

```text
true / false
```

The Omni Logic concept exists to explore these future possibilities while preserving runtime safety.

---

# 2. Current Status

Omni Logic is:

```text
concept specified
research/planning only
not implemented
```

It is not required for the Galerina v0.1 runtime.

---

# 3. Core Philosophy

Omni Logic should:

```text
extend reasoning
not replace runtime safety
```

The system should help model:

```text
uncertainty
confidence
conflicting evidence
partial truth
unknown states
AI reasoning outcomes
```

without weakening:

```text
security
runtime governance
capability enforcement
compiler guarantees
policy enforcement
```

---

# 4. Binary Safety Rule

Critical runtime systems should remain deterministic.

The following should remain binary-safe:

```text
memory safety
runtime policy enforcement
capability checks
cryptographic verification
module integrity
compiler correctness
execution approval
```

Omni Logic must not override these systems.

---

# 5. Why Omni Logic Exists

Traditional binary logic works well for:

```text
security checks
exact computation
compiler rules
runtime scheduling
```

But future systems may require reasoning such as:

```text
AI confidence scoring
uncertain sensor data
partial distributed consensus
conflicting runtime evidence
future planning systems
```

Example:

```text
The runtime may not know whether a remote node is trustworthy yet.
```

Binary logic forces:

```text
true or false
```

Omni Logic may allow:

```text
unknown
pending
conflicted
probable
```

---

# 6. Core Omni Logic Principle

Omni Logic should remain:

```text
advisory unless explicitly approved
```

Meaning:

```text
Omni reasoning may assist runtime planning
Omni reasoning may assist AI orchestration
Omni reasoning may assist distributed systems
```

But:

```text
Omni reasoning should not silently bypass deterministic governance
```

---

# 7. Potential Omni Logic States

Possible future states:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TRUE` | confirmed true |
| `FALSE` | confirmed false |
| `UNKNOWN` | insufficient information |
| `PENDING` | awaiting verification |
| `CONFLICT` | contradictory evidence |
| `PROBABLE` | likely true |
| `IMPROBABLE` | likely false |
| `DEFERRED` | runtime postponed decision |

These are conceptual only for now.

---

# 8. Example Omni State Declaration

Conceptual example:

```galerina
let verification = OmniState.UNKNOWN
```

---

# 9. Example AI Confidence Reasoning

```galerina
fn evaluate_signal(signal: AISignal) -> OmniState {
    if signal.confidence > 0.95 {
        return OmniState.TRUE
    }

    if signal.confidence < 0.40 {
        return OmniState.FALSE
    }

    return OmniState.UNKNOWN
}
```

Meaning:

```text
AI result exists
confidence insufficient for deterministic acceptance
```

---

# 10. Example Conflict State

```galerina
fn compare_cluster_votes(votes: ClusterVotes) -> OmniState {
    if votes.approved > votes.denied {
        return OmniState.PROBABLE
    }

    if votes.approved == votes.denied {
        return OmniState.CONFLICT
    }

    return OmniState.FALSE
}
```

---

# 11. Potential Omni Logic Categories

Suggested categories:

| Category | Purpose |
|---|---|
| certainty | confidence reasoning |
| distributed | cluster consensus |
| ai | AI orchestration |
| probabilistic | probability reasoning |
| temporal | future or delayed states |
| optical | future optical compute abstraction |

---

# Part A: Runtime Safety Boundaries

---

# 12. Omni Logic Restrictions

Omni Logic must not:

```text
override runtime policy
bypass compiler checks
bypass capability checks
control memory safety
bypass deployment governance
bypass cryptographic verification
silently escalate authority
```

---

# 13. Unsafe Example

Bad idea:

```galerina
if ai_decision == OmniState.PROBABLE {
    bypass_security()
}
```

Reason:

```text
probabilistic logic should not replace deterministic security policy
```

---

# 14. Safe Example

Better:

```galerina
let ai_result = evaluate_signal(signal)

if ai_result == OmniState.TRUE {
    return Recommendation.APPROVE
}

return Recommendation.REVIEW_REQUIRED
```

Meaning:

```text
Omni reasoning informs workflow
human or deterministic runtime still decides
```

---

# 15. Deterministic Runtime Rule

Final execution approval should remain binary.

Example:

```text
deployment approved: yes/no
capability granted: yes/no
module allowed: yes/no
```

Not:

```text
probably approved
```

---

# Part B: Omni Logic Runtime Concepts

---

# 16. Potential Runtime Uses

Possible future runtime uses:

```text
AI orchestration
runtime planning
cluster coordination
distributed confidence scoring
sensor fusion
adaptive scheduling
future photonic coordination
```

---

# 17. AI Orchestration Example

```galerina
fn route_ai_task(task: AITask) -> OmniState {
    if runtime.accelerator_available() {
        return OmniState.TRUE
    }

    if runtime.cluster_available() {
        return OmniState.PROBABLE
    }

    return OmniState.FALSE
}
```

---

# 18. Adaptive Runtime Example

Conceptual:

```galerina
fn evaluate_runtime_pressure(state: RuntimeState)
    -> OmniState
{
    if state.cpu_load > 0.95 {
        return OmniState.CONFLICT
    }

    return OmniState.TRUE
}
```

Meaning:

```text
runtime conditions may not have a clean binary answer
```

---

# 19. Distributed Coordination Example

```galerina
fn evaluate_cluster_health(cluster: Cluster)
    -> OmniState
{
    if cluster.nodes_online == cluster.nodes_total {
        return OmniState.TRUE
    }

    if cluster.nodes_online == 0 {
        return OmniState.FALSE
    }

    return OmniState.PARTIAL
}
```

Conceptual only.

---

# Part C: Omni Logic and AI Systems

---

# 20. Why AI Systems Need Richer Logic

AI systems often produce:

```text
confidence
probability
ranking
ambiguity
multiple competing outcomes
```

Traditional boolean logic may lose useful context.

---

# 21. AI Recommendation Example

```galerina
type Recommendation = {
    confidence: Float,
    state: OmniState
}
```

Example:

```galerina
return Recommendation {
    confidence: 0.78,
    state: OmniState.PROBABLE
}
```

---

# 22. Human Review Pattern

Recommended pattern:

```galerina
if recommendation.state == OmniState.PROBABLE {
    require_manual_review()
}
```

This preserves deterministic governance.

---

# Part D: Omni Logic and Photonic Systems

---

# 23. Photonic Relationship

Future photonic systems may involve:

```text
non-traditional signalling
high-speed distributed coordination
wave-based transport
probabilistic coordination
```

Omni Logic may help model these systems conceptually.

---

# 24. Important Restriction

Galerina should not assume:

```text
photonic systems eliminate deterministic computing
```

The runtime still requires:

```text
deterministic governance
secure execution
binary-safe enforcement
```

---

# 25. Optical Coordination Example

Conceptual:

```galerina
fn evaluate_optical_route(route: OpticalRoute)
    -> OmniState
{
    if route.latency < 2 {
        return OmniState.TRUE
    }

    return OmniState.PROBABLE
}
```

---

# Part E: Omni Logic Execution Models

---

# 26. Deterministic vs Advisory Execution

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| deterministic | required for security/runtime enforcement |
| advisory | optional reasoning assistance |

Omni Logic should default to:

```text
advisory
```

---

# 27. Recommended Runtime Boundary

```text
compiler
runtime policy
capability system
memory safety
```

remain deterministic.

Omni Logic may assist:

```text
planning
recommendation
routing
AI coordination
```

---

# 28. Example Recommendation Engine

```galerina
fn recommend_target(task: ComputeTask)
    -> OmniState
{
    if task.parallelism > 0.9 {
        return OmniState.PROBABLE
    }

    return OmniState.UNKNOWN
}
```

The runtime still decides final target.

---

# Part F: Compiler and Runtime Integration

---

# 29. Compiler Integration

Future compiler support may include:

```text
OmniState types
confidence propagation
reasoning metadata
advisory execution graphs
```

But:

```text
compiler safety rules remain deterministic
```

---

# 30. Runtime Integration

Possible runtime integrations:

```text
AI orchestration planner
cluster coordinator
runtime balancing advisor
adaptive scheduling
```

---

# 31. Example Runtime Planning Metadata

```json
{
  "module": "app/ai/orchestrator",
  "omniLogic": true,
  "advisoryOnly": true
}
```

---

# 32. Explain CLI Example

```bash
galerina explain app/ai/orchestrator
```

Output:

```text
Omni Logic advisory reasoning detected.

Deterministic runtime policy still enforced.
```

---

# 33. Audit Event Example

```json
{
  "traceId": "trace-1000",
  "category": "omni_logic",
  "state": "PROBABLE",
  "advisory": true
}
```

---

# Part G: Governance and Safety

---

# 34. Governance Rules

Omni Logic systems should:

```text
be auditable
be explainable
be isolated from core security enforcement
be optional
be explicitly enabled
```

---

# 35. Explicit Enablement Example

Conceptual:

```galerina
feature omni_logic
```

Reason:

```text
advanced reasoning should not silently appear in deterministic applications
```

---

# 36. Runtime Audit Requirements

Omni reasoning should generate:

```text
reasoning traces
confidence metadata
advisory state records
runtime explanation metadata
```

---

# 37. Example Reasoning Trace

```json
{
  "traceId": "trace-1100",
  "reasoning": [
    "accelerator unavailable",
    "cluster partially available",
    "fallback recommended"
  ],
  "state": "PROBABLE"
}
```

---

# Part H: Future Research Areas

---

# 38. Possible Future Research

Potential future areas:

```text
multi-valued logic
probabilistic execution planning
AI-assisted runtime governance
adaptive distributed systems
optical coordination models
confidence-aware scheduling
```

---

# 39. Things Galerina Should Avoid

Avoid:

```text
replacing deterministic governance
non-auditable AI reasoning
hidden probabilistic execution
automatic authority escalation
unsafe self-modifying runtime logic
```

---

# 40. Suggested Diagnostics

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `FUNGI-OMNI-001` | Omni logic feature disabled |
| `FUNGI-OMNI-002` | advisory logic attempted privileged action |
| `FUNGI-OMNI-003` | unsupported Omni state |
| `FUNGI-OMNI-004` | non-deterministic logic used in restricted runtime path |
| `FUNGI-OMNI-005` | Omni reasoning trace missing |

---

# 41. Required Test Cases

## Governance tests

```text
Omni logic cannot bypass policy
Omni logic cannot grant capabilities
Omni logic cannot bypass deployment checks
```

## Runtime tests

```text
advisory state recorded
reasoning trace generated
feature flag enforced
```

## AI orchestration tests

```text
confidence states handled
unknown states handled
conflict states handled
```

---

# 42. Recommended v0.1 Scope

Recommended v0.1 implementation:

```text
none
```

Recommended v0.1 documentation:

```text
concept definition
safety boundaries
future planning guidance
```

Reason:

```text
runtime governance and compiler correctness should mature first
```

---

# 43. Suggested Future Phases

| Phase | Focus |
|---|---|
| Phase 1 | advisory OmniState types |
| Phase 2 | runtime reasoning traces |
| Phase 3 | AI orchestration integration |
| Phase 4 | distributed coordination models |
| Phase 5 | advanced heterogeneous planning |

---

# 44. Relationship to Compute Layer

Omni Logic may eventually assist:

```text
GPU planning
accelerator selection
cluster balancing
optical routing
```

But:

```text
runtime execution remains governed by deterministic policy
```

---

# 45. Final Recommendation

Galerina should treat Omni Logic as:

```text
future reasoning infrastructure
```

not:

```text
replacement runtime truth
```

The platform should preserve:

```text
binary-safe governance
explicit authority
runtime auditability
deterministic security enforcement
```

while allowing future experimentation with:

```text
AI reasoning
uncertainty modelling
probabilistic orchestration
heterogeneous distributed systems
future photonic coordination
```

This allows Galerina to explore advanced compute concepts without sacrificing runtime safety.
