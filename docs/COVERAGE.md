# Galerina Documentation Coverage

This document tracks what has been documented, what needs more depth, and what
is still missing across the three primary areas of the language specification,
plus the package documentation status.

```text
✅ Covered — dedicated KB file exists with full specification
⚠️  Partial — touched in a KB file but needs its own dedicated document
❌ Missing — not yet documented, work still required
```

| Security — v0.2 formal spec | ✅ | `galerina-core-security-v02.md` **Update status: conflict resolved (2026-05-26)** — canonical public API is `unwrapForApprovedSink(sink)`; `revealUnsafeForRuntimeOnly()` is private internal only; KB updated to match |
| Signed Attestation — Ed25519 artifact signing | ✅ | `galerina-signed-attestation.md` — attestation pipeline, YAML format, key_id rotation, Stage 2 post-quantum ML-DSA/SLH-DSA plan (2026-05-30) |
| Governed Memory Blocks — runtime integrity | ✅ | `galerina-governed-memory-blocks.md` — GMB structure, three-layer enforcement, ARM MTE/CHERI future hardware, contract rules syntax (2026-05-30) |
| Flow Contract Full Model — canonical section reference | ✅ | `galerina-contract-full-model.md` — all 16 sections incl. errors/timeouts/retries/limits/privacy/observability, named result types, canonical order (2026-05-30) |
| Contract errors {} section | ✅ | `galerina-contract-errors.md` — error mapping, expose/redact/audit, connection to Result<T,E> (2026-05-30) |
| Contract operational constraints — timeouts/retries/limits | ✅ | `galerina-contract-operational-constraints.md` — deadline, retry policy, resource limits, unlimited prohibition (2026-05-30) |
| Contract privacy and observability sections | ✅ | `galerina-contract-privacy-observability.md` — PII rules, retention, deny patterns, observability sees execution not data (2026-05-30) |
| Naming conventions — request not req, rawX for unsafe, FlowNameResult | ✅ | `galerina-naming-conventions.md` — accepted style direction, full param names, local binding rules (2026-05-30) |
| Phase 11 design decisions — loops, mut, CEC CI, graph module, result-of, contract runtime | ✅ | `galerina-phase-11-decisions.md` — 6 recorded decisions with rationale (2026-05-30) |
| Phase 10 Roadmap — 10A/10B/10C plan | ✅ | `galerina-phase-10-roadmap.md` — attestation module, governance enforcement, governed memory blocks (2026-05-30) |
| Photonic — v0.2 formal spec | ⚠️ | `galerina-core-photonic-v02.md` ⚠️ **Update status: not implementation-ready** — OpticalTransportMode enum (Waveguide\|Coherent\|Mesh\|FreeSpace\|Hybrid\|Experimental) conflicts with governance spec (DIRECT\|WAVELENGTH\|PACKETIZED\|HYBRID\|EMULATED\|SIMULATED) and vector spec (electrical\|hybrid\|photonic\|waveguide\|plasmonic\|coherent); reconciliation required before any implementation |
| Tri Logic developer guide — v0.2 | ⚠️ | `galerina-core-logic-tristate-developer-guide.md` ⚠️ **Update status: predates current v0.2 shape** — Decision shown as 3-state (allow/deny/unknown), BoolBoundaryResult lacks diagnostics[]; use package README and `galerina-core-logic-tri-decision-bool.md` as canonical; kind: discriminant is standard |
| API server full implementation spec | ⚠️ | `galerina-framework-api-server-implementation.md` ⚠️ **Update status: adapter-level names** — `ReplayStore.exists()/save()` are adapter-level; canonical network contract is `has()/put(ttlSeconds)` from `galerina-core-network-webhook.md`; mapping or name adoption required before implementation |
| Vector photonic governance (proposed) | ⚠️ | `galerina-core-vector-photonic-governance.md` ⚠️ **Update status: proposal/reference note only** — galerina-core-photonic owns final definitions after reconciliation |

## Summary: Remaining Gaps

### Priority 1 — Core Syntax (resolved)

```text
✅ Import / module system syntax — module-system-and-visibility.md
✅ Visibility (public / private) — module-system-and-visibility.md
```

### Priority 2 — Logic (resolved)

```text
✅ Error propagation through call chains — error-propagation-chains.md
```

### Priority 3 — Runtime (resolved)

```text
✅ CI/CD integration (OIDC, SLSA provenance, attestation workflow) — cicd-integration-and-provenance.md

✅ Compile-time vs runtime authority — compile-time-vs-runtime-authority.md
```

### Priority 4 — Package Implementation (key gaps remaining)

Each entry below lists the KB references, the package status, and any blocking conflicts.

KB references in this section are under `docs/Knowledge-Bases/`. Manual source
check performed against the referenced KB files plus package README/TODO files
on 2026-05-25. Where package docs and KB files disagree, the entry calls that
out before implementation.

#### Remaining Action Index

| Package area | Next action | Blocking conflict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `galerina-core-compiler` effect/boundary | Reconcile effect/boundary model and diagnostic-code meanings before implementation | README/TODO and KB specs use different effect/boundary shapes and code ranges |
| `galerina-core-compiler` manifest pass 14 | Bring package README/TODO up to pass-14 integrity/stable-serialization contract, then implement | `ManifestIntegrity`, `serializeManifestStable()`, and `buildManifestIntegrity()` are in pass-14 KB, not package README/TODO |
| `galerina-core-cli` build/verify/deploy/explain/plan | Finish build/verify and implement deploy/explain/plan command paths | None documented |
| `galerina-core-reports` audit/proof/denial/evidence/trace | Finalise package contracts and implementation for report schemas; add FlowTraceEvent contract and JSONL writer (SPORE-TRACE-001–005) | None documented |
| `galerina-core-compute` GPU/photonic/WASM/compat | Keep as planning until backend and target compatibility implementation starts | Photonic ownership and enum conflicts affect photonic plan output |
| `galerina-core-logic` Tri/Decision/Bool/Omni | Implement v0.2 canonical runtime contracts — TODO items corrected to canonical README shapes (2026-05-26) | KB alignment complete; v0.2 TODO items now use `kind:` discriminant, `value` fields, `UnknownReason`, 4-state Decision + evidence, correct OmniState snake_case literals |
| `galerina-core-config` environment/secrets/vault | Implement EnvironmentConfig v0.2, SecretEnvironmentReference loading/reporting, ConfigVault (SPORE-VAULT-001–005) — SecretConfigSource naming resolved (2026-05-26) | Canonical `SecretConfigSource`: `env\|vault\|kms\|runtime`; Config Vault and .env trust model KBs added |
| `galerina-core-security` secret/taint | Implement v0.2 secret reference model — ProtectedSecret unwrap API resolved (2026-05-26) | Canonical: `unwrapForApprovedSink(sink)`; `private revealUnsafeForRuntimeOnly()` internal only |
| `galerina-core-network` governance/webhook | Implement v0.2 contracts — legacy name audit complete (2026-05-26) | TODO corrected: `ReplayStore.insertOnce()` → `has/put(key,ttlSeconds)`, `IdempotencyStore.getOrSet()` → `get(key)/put(record,ttlSeconds?)` |
| `galerina-core-photonic` governance | Reconcile enum, diagnostic table and ownership before implementation | Three incompatible `OpticalTransportMode` forms and diagnostic tables |
| `galerina-core-vector` photonic proposal | Keep proposal-only until photonic ownership is resolved | Boundary conflict with `galerina-core-photonic` |
| `galerina-framework-api-server` implementation | Map adapter replay/idempotency names to network canonical contracts | `exists()/save()` differs from network `has()/put()` |

**galerina-core-compiler: effect checker and boundary checker**

- KB: `effect-checker-and-boundary-checker.md`, `galerina-core-effect-checker-v02.md`
- README/KB: Effect/CheckedFunction/EffectGraphNode/EffectGraph and boundary
  types are specified, but not yet reconciled into a single canonical checker
  model.
- Manual check: package README/TODO use the newer `EffectCategory` model
  (`network|database|filesystem|shell|process|secret|ai|gpu|native|custom`) and
  an expanded boundary model; `galerina-core-effect-checker-v02.md` still uses the
  older `Effect` enum and 5-value `BoundaryType`. The canonical KB
  `effect-checker-and-boundary-checker.md` also records fuller
  `EffectReference`/`BoundaryGraph` contracts and code meanings.
- Status: ⚠️ specified across sources, but implementation should first reconcile
  the checker model and diagnostic-code meanings into one package contract.

**galerina-core-compiler: manifest generation (pass 14)**

- KB: `galerina-core-manifest-generation-v02.md`, `galerina-core-compiler-manifest-generation-pass-14.md`
- README/KB: README covers RuntimeManifest v0.2 with RouteManifest/
  FunctionManifest/EffectManifest/BoundaryManifest; pass-14 KB adds
  ManifestIntegrity 5-hash type, serializeManifestStable(), and
  buildManifestIntegrity().
- Manual check: package README/TODO include `RuntimeManifest`, route/function/
  effect/boundary manifests, `buildManifest()`, and `validateManifest()`.
  `ManifestIntegrity`, `serializeManifestStable()`, and
  `buildManifestIntegrity()` are present in
  `galerina-core-compiler-manifest-generation-pass-14.md`, not in the package
  README/TODO yet.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified in KB v0.2/pass-14 docs, but package README/TODO
  still need the integrity and stable-serialization contract before
  implementation.

**galerina-core-cli: galerina build, verify, deploy, explain, plan**

- KB: `galerina-core-cli-deploy-explain-plan.md`, `galerina-core-cli-v02.md`
- README: BuildArtefact/BuildResult/buildWorkspace, VerifiedArtefact/VerificationResult/verifyHash, DeploymentTarget 7 values, ExplainTrace/ExplainResult/buildTrace, ComputePlan/estimateTarget, exit codes 0–7
- Manual check: package README and TODO both cover build/verify/deploy/explain/
  plan; TODO items remain unchecked for completing build/verify and implementing
  deploy/explain/plan paths.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified v0.2; build and verify partial, others not yet implemented

**galerina-core-reports: runtime audit log / execution proof / denials / evidence**

- KB: `runtime-audit-log-format.md`, `galerina-core-reports-v02.md`
- README: RuntimeAuditStatus v0.2, RuntimeAuditEvent v0.2, ExecutionProofHashes 5 hashes, DenialReport v0.2, all evidence types v0.2, validateAuditSafety
- Manual check: package README contains v0.2 report contracts, but still marks
  the current `ExecutionProof` form as v0.1 active until v0.2 is finalised; TODO
  keeps the v0.2 upgrades open.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified v0.2, not yet finalised in package

**galerina-core-compute: GPU / photonic backends; WASM target; target compatibility**

- KB: `galerina-core-compute-gpu-and-photonic-backends.md`, `galerina-core-compute-v02.md`
- README: GpuSuitability/GpuPlan v0.2, OpticalNeed/OpticalPlan, WasmTarget extended with runtime+forbiddenEffects, CompatibilityLevel/Blockers/Warnings, TargetProfile, CompatibilityReport, shared ComputeWorkload/DataShape types
- Manual check: package README/TODO and both KBs match the broad v0.2 planning
  scope. TODO keeps the V1 freeze as CPU target selection plus compute planning
  only.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified v0.2, planning only (v0.1 = CPU + compute planner only)

**galerina-core-logic: Tri logic, Decision logic, Bool boundary rules, Omni logic**

- KB (canonical): `galerina-core-logic-tri-decision-bool.md`, `galerina-core-logic-omni-logic.md`
- KB (superseded): `galerina-core-logic-v02.md` — ⚠️ Update status: type: discriminant, 3-state Decision; use package README as canonical
- KB (superseded): `galerina-core-logic-tristate-developer-guide.md` — ⚠️ Update status: predates v0.2; Decision shown as 3-state; use package README as canonical
- README: TriState v0.2 with value field + UnknownReason, Decision 4-state with review kind + DecisionEvidence, BoolBoundaryResult with diagnostics[] + reason, OmniState snake_case + OmniEvidence, omniToDecision→review; Coverage Reconciliation Status at top
- TODO first item: "Align older v0.2 KB/developer-guide examples with current README canonical kind/evidence/review shape"
- Manual check: canonical README and KBs align on 4-state Decision/review and
  evidence arrays, but the developer guide and later TODO items still include
  older examples such as `triUnknown(reason?)`, `{kind:"unknown", reason?}`,
  and older BoolBoundaryResult wording.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified v0.2 (with breaking changes); v0.1 implementation = none

**galerina-core-config: environment config model; secret reference model**

- KB: `galerina-core-config-environment-secrets.md`, `galerina-core-config-v02.md`
- README: ConfigValue discriminated union, EnvironmentPolicy, defaultEnvironmentPolicy(), EnvironmentConfig v0.2 with schemaVersion, SecretEnvironmentReference v0.2, SecretConfigSource discriminated union, LoadEnvironmentConfigInput, loadEnvironmentConfig(), EnvironmentConfigReport, SecretReportValue
- Manual check (2026-05-26): SecretConfigSource naming conflict resolved — canonical `env|vault|kms|runtime`; `galerina-core-config-environment-secrets.md` updated; TODO updated. ConfigDiagnostic `name` field added to KB and implementation. Diagnostic codes renamed from `Galerina_CONFIG_*` to `SPORE-CONFIG-001…027` with `{code, name, message}` metadata. Config keeps `ProtectedSecret` as a simple interface; `galerina-core-security` owns the full class.
- Status: ✅ SecretConfigSource conflict resolved; implementation unblocked for EnvironmentConfig v0.2 and SecretEnvironmentReference loading/reporting

**galerina-core-security: secret reference model with taint tracking**

- KB (canonical): `galerina-core-security-secret-reference-model.md`
- KB (updated): `galerina-core-security-v02.md` — ✅ **conflict resolved (2026-05-26)** — `unwrapForApprovedSink(sink)` canonical; `private revealUnsafeForRuntimeOnly()` internal only; SecretSource renamed from `environment/file/secretStore/runtimeInjected` to `env/vault/kms/runtime|oauth|token`
- README: SecretSource discriminated union (env|vault|kms|runtime|oauth|token), SecretCategory 13 values, SecretRedactionPolicy, SecretReference v0.2, ProtectedSecret<T> full impl with unwrapForApprovedSink(sink), SecretSafeSink extended, SecretTaint, safeLog, buildAuthorizationHeader; Coverage Reconciliation Status updated to resolved
- TODO first item: checked off — ProtectedSecret API resolved (2026-05-26)
- Manual check (2026-05-26): all files aligned on `unwrapForApprovedSink(sink)` as the single public API; `revealUnsafeForRuntimeOnly()` marked private throughout.
- Status: ✅ ProtectedSecret conflict resolved; fully specified v0.2; implementation unblocked

**galerina-core-network: governance model**

- KB (canonical): `galerina-core-network-governance.md`, `galerina-core-network-webhook.md`
- KB (superseded): `galerina-core-network-v02.md` — uses sharedSecret field and has()/store(); superseded by webhook KB canonical names
- README: NetworkProtocol 7 values, NetworkPolicy with allowDestinations/denyDestinations/default, productionNetworkPolicy SSRF-safe, AiProviderNetworkPolicy/OPENAI_POLICY, GovernedNetworkRuntime, WebhookVerificationConfig v0.2, IdempotencyRecord with status field; Coverage Reconciliation Status at top
- TODO first item: "Audit docs for legacy ws/wss, sharedSecret, exists/save and has/store wording"; remaining TODO items still reference old names — must be updated during implementation
- Manual check: package README and `galerina-core-network-webhook.md` agree on
  `ReplayStore.has/put` and `IdempotencyStore.get/put(IdempotencyRecord)`.
  `galerina-core-network-v02.md` still uses legacy protocol/secret/store names,
  and `galerina-core-network-governance.md` also differs from the webhook KB for
  idempotency (`has/put(key)` instead of `get/put(record)`). Package TODO still
  contains older `insertOnce()/has()` and `getOrSet()` wording.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified v0.2 (with breaking protocol changes), not yet implemented

**galerina-core-photonic: governance architecture**

- KB (legacy/historical): `galerina-core-photonic-backend-architecture.md` — ⚠️ Update status: prior 3-value OpticalTransportMode and original SPORE-PHOTONIC-001–006 meanings; historical context only
- KB (conflicting v0.2): `galerina-core-photonic-v02.md` — ⚠️ Update status: not implementation-ready; OpticalTransportMode 6-value enum conflicts with governance spec and vector spec; reconciliation required
- KB (governance spec): `galerina-core-photonic-governance-architecture.md` — DIRECT|WAVELENGTH|PACKETIZED|HYBRID|EMULATED|SIMULATED — also conflicts; see version conflict notes
- README: v0.2 Architecture Depth section added; Coverage Reconciliation Status (unresolved: enum, diagnostic table, package boundary)
- TODO first three items: "Reconcile canonical OpticalTransportMode enum", "Reconcile canonical SPORE-PHOTONIC-001–006 table", "Confirm ownership before implementation"
- Manual check: package README/TODO still contain both the prior 3-value
  `OpticalTransportMode` and a proposed v0.2 6-value enum after the warning
  block. Treat later implementation snippets as historical/proposed until the
  first three reconciliation TODOs are resolved.
- Status: ⚠️ prior and v0.2 both fully specified; NOT implementation-ready — 3 unresolved conflicts

**galerina-core-vector: photonic governance proposal**

- KB: `galerina-core-vector-photonic-governance.md` — OpticalTransportMode prior 3-value + v0.2 6-value "electrical"|"hybrid"|"photonic"|"waveguide"|"plasmonic"|"coherent", PhotonicCapability 6-value, PhotonicTopology 6-value, PhotonicRuntimeTarget/PhotonicExecutionPlan v0.2, all validation functions, SPORE-PHOTONIC-001–006 prior+v0.2, deny-by-default fallback, BOUNDARY CONFLICT documented
- ⚠️ Update status: proposal/reference note only — galerina-core-photonic owns final definitions after reconciliation
- README: Boundary conflict note + Coverage Reconciliation Status; vector does not own photonic runtime target semantics
- TODO first item: "Treat vector photonic governance notes as proposal-only until ownership reconciled"
- Manual check: package README still lists proposed photonic runtime contracts
  after the boundary warning. They remain proposal-only and must not be treated
  as owned implementation contracts for vector.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified (both prior + v0.2); BOUNDARY CONFLICT must be resolved before implementation

**galerina-framework-api-server: full API server implementation**

- KB (prior): `galerina-api-boundary-architecture.md`
- KB (v0.2 formal spec): `galerina-framework-api-server-v02.md` (ReplayStore {exists/save} — differs from network package)
- KB (full impl spec): `galerina-framework-api-server-implementation.md` — ⚠️ Update status: ReplayStore.exists()/save() are adapter-level names; canonical contract is galerina-core-network has()/put(ttlSeconds)
- README: v0.2 implementation spec (section 30) with all types, 10-step pipeline, security rules, HTTP status contract; Coverage Reconciliation Status added
- TODO first two items: "Map API-server ReplayStore.exists/save adapter names to galerina-core-network has/put", "Align webhook/idempotency implementation docs with galerina-core-network-webhook.md"
- Manual check: package README, TODO, and full implementation KB still contain
  `ReplayStore.exists/save` in the implementation section after the warning.
  Those names are adapter-level until mapped or renamed to the network canonical
  `has/put` contract.
- Status: ⚠️ fully specified with complete implementation guide; not yet implemented; ReplayStore name mapping required before implementation

## 5. Implementation Build Scope

### Implementation Language and Bootstrap Strategy

**Two-stage bootstrap:**

**Stage 1 — Bootstrap runtime (current):** Plain JavaScript (`.js` files running directly
in Node.js, no build step, no compilation). The execution engine — parser, type checker,
interpreter, runtime kernel — is implemented as JavaScript. `galerina-core/compiler/galerina.js`
is the existing foundation and the correct shape for this stage. Stage 1 packages extend
that pattern: `.js` files that Node.js can `require` or `import` directly.

**Stage 2 — Self-hosted runtime:** Once the Stage 1 JavaScript runtime can compile and
execute Galerina programs, the runtime itself will be rewritten in Galerina's own
language/syntax. This is the self-hosting milestone.

See `bootstrap-runtime-roadmap.md` and `node-hosted-runtime-roadmap.md` for the full
stage plan (Node.js bootstrap → Neutral IR → Rust/WASM → Galerina self-hosted).

**Existing TypeScript files:** `galerina-core-cli`, `galerina-core-config` and
`galerina-core-logic` contain TypeScript files from earlier contract and tooling work. These
are the tooling and contract layer — not the runtime engine itself. They remain where they
are for now; the Stage 1 runtime engine grows from `compiler/galerina.js` outward. Whether
the tooling layer migrates to plain JavaScript or stays as TypeScript is a separate
decision made per package when implementation begins.

### Phase 1 Package Build Selection

Stage 1 runtime files are plain `.js` files that run directly in Node.js. No build step.
No compilation. `galerina-core/compiler/galerina.js` is the existing foundation and the model
for all Stage 1 runtime additions.

| Package | Decision | Stage 1 notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `galerina-core` | **Runtime foundation** | `compiler/galerina.js` is the Stage 1 root — parser, type checker, formatter prototype already in JavaScript; runtime engine grows from here; no `src/` directory needed |
| `galerina-core-cli` | **Include** | CLI tooling layer — 10 TypeScript files present from earlier contract work; `check` and `fmt` working; `build`, `verify`, `deploy`, `explain`, `plan` command bodies are the remaining gaps; language decision (keep TypeScript or migrate to `.js`) made when those commands are implemented |
| `galerina-core-config` | **Include (scope-limited)** | Config and policy layer — TypeScript implemented (`ProjectConfig`/`EnvironmentConfig`/`RuntimeConfigHandoff`/`ProductionStrictnessPolicy`/`loadConfigFromObjects`/`validateHostPackageManifestBoundary`); diagnostic codes renamed to SPORE-CONFIG-001…027; SecretConfigSource conflict resolved (2026-05-26) — v0.2 secret config surface now unblocked |
| `galerina-core-logic` | **Include (v0.1 extensions)** | Runtime logic layer — 418 lines TypeScript v0.1 numeric Tri (`Tri = -1\|0\|1`, `TriBoolPolicy`, generic `LogicState<N>`/`LogicDefinition<N>` framework); extend v0.1 with missing operations; v0.2 discriminated union rewrite is a separate milestone after self-hosting is achievable |
| `galerina-core-network` | **Add** | Runtime network layer — canonical v0.2 contracts in `galerina-core-network-webhook.md` are clean and unblocked (`WebhookRequest`/`WebhookResponse`, `IdempotencyRecord`, `ReplayStore.has/put`, `IdempotencyStore.get/put(IdempotencyRecord)`); high-value dependency for `galerina-framework-api-server`; no blocking conflicts |

### Surfaces Deferred from Phase 1

| Surface | Package | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SecretConfigSource` / `SecretEnvironmentReference` / `loadEnvironmentConfig` | `galerina-core-config` | **Resolved (2026-05-26)** — canonical: `env\|vault\|kms\|runtime`; KB and TODO updated; implementation unblocked |
| `ProtectedSecret<T>` unwrap API | `galerina-core-security` | **Resolved (2026-05-26)** — canonical: `unwrapForApprovedSink(sink)`; `private revealUnsafeForRuntimeOnly()` internal only; KB and TODO updated |
| `OpticalTransportMode` / SPORE-PHOTONIC diagnostic codes | `galerina-core-photonic` | Three incompatible 6-value enums; diagnostic code meanings differ across prior KB, v0.2 formal and vector spec |
| v0.2 `TriState` / `Decision` / `BoolBoundaryResult` / `OmniState` discriminated unions | `galerina-core-logic` | Phase 1 ships v0.1 extensions; v0.2 rewrite is a separate milestone |
| `ReplayStore.exists/save` adapter name mapping | `galerina-framework-api-server` | Must be mapped to canonical `has/put(ttlSeconds)` before implementation can proceed |
| `src/` contracts | `galerina-core` | No `src/` directory; no shared base contracts defined; deferred to a later pass |
