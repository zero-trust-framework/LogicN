# Why Controllers Are Not Core LogicN

## Recommendation

LogicN should not require traditional MVC controllers.

The secure core should be route-first and contract-first:

```text
Routes define the public contract.
Actions or handlers do the work.
Policies define security.
Effects define what the route is allowed to touch.
Reports explain everything.
```

Controller-style grouping may be supported later as optional framework sugar,
but it must compile into the same secure route graph and must not hide auth,
CSRF, object access, permissions, validation, limits, idempotency, audit or
effects.

## Preferred Model

Use this structure:

```text
Route Contract
  -> Security Policy
  -> Request Type
  -> Handler / Action
  -> Allowed Effects
  -> Response Type
  -> Generated Report
```

Preferred names:

```text
route    = public HTTP/API contract
action   = function that performs route work
handler  = runtime entry point bound to the route
policy   = security and permission rules
effect   = what the route is allowed to access
resource = domain object such as Order, User or Payment
```

## Route Example

```logicn
route POST "/orders/{orderId: UUID}/cancel" {
  auth required
  csrf required
  audit required

  body CancelOrderRequest
  response CancelOrderResponse

  object_access {
    resource Order
    id orderId
    rule "user owns order OR user is admin"
  }

  effects {
    database ["orders.read", "orders.write"]
    network []
    files []
  }

  limits {
    timeout 2s
    max_body_size 32kb
  }

  handler cancelOrder
}
```

Handler example:

```logicn
action cancelOrder(request: CancelOrderRequest, ctx: RequestContext)
  -> Result<CancelOrderResponse, OrderError>
{
  let order = Orders.find(request.orderId)

  match order {
    None => return Err(OrderNotFound)

    Some(value) => {
      value.cancel()
      Orders.save(value)

      return Ok(CancelOrderResponse {
        status: "cancelled"
      })
    }
  }
}
```

The route declares the security, request shape, response shape, object-access
rule, allowed effects, limits and handler binding in one inspectable place.

## Why Controllers Are Not Ideal For Core LogicN

Traditional controllers can hide important security behavior across:

```text
middleware
route files
annotations
base controllers
service providers
framework config
inherited methods
```

That makes it harder for the compiler, security tools, AI assistants and humans
to answer:

```text
Does this route require auth?
Does it require CSRF?
Can this user access this object?
Is DELETE allowed?
Is this audited?
Can this handler write to the database?
Can this handler call the network?
Does this response expose private fields?
```

Controllers also tend to grow into large files:

```text
OrderController
  index()
  show()
  create()
  store()
  edit()
  update()
  delete()
  refund()
  export()
  email()
  adminApprove()
```

That shape is harder for developers, reviewers, AI tools, tests and route
reports to inspect.

## Performance Position

The word "controller" does not make routing faster or slower.

Runtime speed depends on:

```text
route matching
runtime reflection
middleware chains
dynamic dispatch
dependency loading
request parsing
database calls
handler execution
```

LogicN should aim for static route manifests, route graphs or tries that map a
method/path contract directly to a typed handler with known policy and effects.

## Compile-Time Checks

A route-first LogicN app can fail earlier when security is incomplete.

Examples:

```text
POST route without CSRF policy -> compile/check error
Route with user ID but no object_access rule -> compile/check error
Route writes to database without database.write effect -> compile/check error
Financial route without audit/idempotency -> compile/check error
Admin route without role policy -> compile/check error
Handler returns private fields without response filter -> compile/check error
Production public route without timeout/body limit -> compile/check error
```

Controllers usually rely on framework behavior or runtime middleware to catch
many of these issues. LogicN should move the checks into source, compiler,
kernel and report layers.

## Folder Structure

Recommended app shape:

```text
src/
  boot.lln
  main.lln

  routes/
    orders.routes.lln
    users.routes.lln
    payments.routes.lln

  actions/
    orders/
      createOrder.lln
      cancelOrder.lln
      refundOrder.lln

    users/
      getUserProfile.lln
      updateUserEmail.lln

  models/
    Order.lln
    User.lln
    Payment.lln

  policies/
    orderAccess.policy.lln
    userAccess.policy.lln

  schemas/
    requests/
      CreateOrderRequest.lln
      CancelOrderRequest.lln

    responses/
      OrderResponse.lln
      CancelOrderResponse.lln
```

This is easier for humans and AI assistants to understand than one large
controller file.

## Optional Framework Sugar

Frameworks may later support controller-style grouping:

```logicn
controller OrdersController {
  uses routes from "./routes/orders.routes.lln"
  actions from "./actions/orders"
}
```

But this must be organization only. It must compile to the same route graph as
plain routes and actions.

Controllers must not:

```text
hide auth policy
hide CSRF policy
hide object access rules
hide validation
hide effects
hide idempotency
hide audit requirements
add runtime magic that bypasses route reports
be required by LogicN core
```

## Roadmap Note

This belongs in the App Kernel and framework-review roadmap:

```text
LogicN should not require traditional MVC controllers.

The preferred structure is:
- route contracts
- route actions / handlers
- typed request objects
- typed response objects
- policies
- effects
- generated route reports

Controller-style grouping may be supported later as optional framework sugar,
but it must compile into the same secure route graph and must not hide auth,
CSRF, permissions, validation, limits, idempotency, audit or effects.
```

Final rule:

```text
For LogicN, controllers are optional organization.
Secure typed routes are essential.
```
