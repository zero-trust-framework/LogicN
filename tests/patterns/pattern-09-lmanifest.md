# Pattern 9 — The .lmanifest (Compliance Evidence)

**Profile:** `drcm_core_v1` — DRCM Phase 3 (2026-08)  
**Status:** Documentation only. `.lmanifest` generation is not yet implemented in Stage A.

---

## What it is

The `.lmanifest` is emitted at compile time alongside the `.wasm` binary. It carries machine-verifiable proof of the compiled module's governance properties — data-flow constraints, proof obligations, and a post-quantum signature.

A QSA (Qualified Security Assessor) verifies this file without reading source code.

## Compliance consumers

| Consumer | Uses |
|---|---|
| PCI DSS v4.0 assessor | `derivedConstraints` — proves CardholderData cannot reach telemetry |
| SOC 2 Type II auditor | `proofObligations` — data flow evidence |
| HIPAA compliance tool | `derivedConstraints` — PHI isolation proof |
| DSS admission gate (runtime) | `sourceHash` + `governanceSignature` — verified before any DWI loads |

---

## How to produce it (Phase 3)

```
logicn build --manifest payment-service.lln
# Outputs: build/payment-service.wasm
#           build/payment-service.lmanifest
```

---

## DSS admission gate (Phase 3)

Before loading any DWI guest module, the DSS verifies:
1. `SHA-256(payment-service.wasm)` == `manifest.sourceHash`
2. ML-DSA-65 signature verifies with the compiler signing key

If either check fails: `LLN-ID-001` — the module is rejected, never instantiated.
