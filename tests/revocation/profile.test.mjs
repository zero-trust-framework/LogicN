/**
 * FAIL-SECURE GALERINA_PROFILE resolution (audit 2026-06-20).
 *
 * The signing/admission gates key their strict behaviour on "is this production?". Resolving that
 * fail-OPEN (anything ≠ "production" ⇒ dev) lets a typo'd value silently disable enforcement. This
 * resolver is fail-SECURE: only unset/empty or an explicitly-recognized dev token relaxes to dev;
 * a set-but-unrecognized value resolves to production. Mirrors core-config posture.ts.
 *
 * (Run by the governance test step; the package suite covers the end-to-end behaviour in
 *  galerina-core-compiler/tests/cli-compatibility.test.mjs.)
