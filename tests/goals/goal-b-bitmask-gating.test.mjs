/**
 * T-007: Goal B — Single-Cycle Bitmask Capability Gating
 *
 * Validates that capability authorization resolves via a single bitwise AND
 * against the V_DPM register — no string parsing, no policy engine lookups.
 *
 * Reference: docs/Knowledge-Bases/galerina-engineering-goals.md Goal B
 *
 * Acceptance criterion:
 *   - DWI guest with V_DPM = 0b11111110 (network bit cleared) attempts network.outbound
 *   - Call is trapped BEFORE any data exits the sandbox
 *   - Trap fires in ≤ 1 CPU instruction cycle
 *   - V_DPM unchanged after trap (trap is not a permission grant)
 *   - Subsequent attempt with V_DPM = 0b11111111 succeeds
 *
 * STATUS: TODO — requires DRCM Phase 5 (DSS.wasm + DWI isolates + V_DPM register)
 * See tasks: #40 (step keyword + DWI), #41 (DSS supervisor)
 *
 * This file is a placeholder with the complete test specification.
 * Implement when DRCM Phase 5 ships.
